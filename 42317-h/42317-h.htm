<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><i>Place for the Book.</i> As a textbook, <span class="smcap">Industrial Arts Design</span>
is a practical guide for designing in wood, clay, and base and precious
metals. It is intended for individual student use in the High Schools,
Normal Schools, and Colleges and as a reference book for elementary
school teachers. Its more complex problems are intended as definite
helps to the industrial arts designer or craftsman. The wood problems
are treated with special reference to their adaptability to bench
and cabinet work.</p>

<p><i>Need of the Book.</i> It has been written to fill a decided demand
for a textbook that shall, without loss of time, directly apply well-recognized
principles of general design to specific materials and
problems encountered in the Industrial Arts. A brief description of
the decorative processes adapted to the materials under discussion
with the design principles directly applying to these processes, insures
designs that may be worked out in the studio or shop. It is hoped
that this provision will eliminate the large number of impractical
designs that are frequently entirely unfitted to the technic of the craft.
This lack of mutual technical understanding between the teacher
of design and the shop work instructor is the cause of friction that it
is hoped will be removed by the methods advocated in these pages.</p>

<p><i>The Author's Motive.</i> It has been the intention to reduce unrelated
and abstract theories to a minimum and reach directly rules
and conclusions that shall be applicable to typical materials in common
use in the schools and industries. The original conception
materialized in the publication of a series of articles upon Design
in the <i>Industrial Arts Magazine</i>, in 1915. These articles were favorably
received and their results in the schools proved highly satisfactory.
Through this encouragement, the articles have been
reprinted in book form, enriched by the addition of illustrations,
review questions, and three chapters on color with its applications.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Industrial Arts Design</span> develops the principles of industrial
design in a new and logical form which, it is believed, will simplify
the teaching of craft design. Chapters <a href="#Chap_I">I</a> to <a href="#Chap_V">V</a> deal with the elementary
problems confronting the designer as he begins the first steps
on his working drawing; Chapters <a href="#Chap_VI">VI</a> to <a href="#Chap_VIII">VIII</a> show the methods by
which he may express his individuality through contour or outline
enrichment, while Chapters <a href="#Chap_IX">IX</a> to <a href="#Chap_XVII">XVII</a> explain the treatment of
the most difficult form of decoration, that of surface enrichment.</p>

<p><i>The Appendix.</i> The <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a> is added to show the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
which the rules may be directly applied to a course of study in either
pottery or art metal. The present work is not intended to include
the chemistry of glaze mixing or other technical requirements to
which reference is made in the appendix; consequently the reader is
referred to "The Potter's Craft" by C.F. Binns and "Pottery" by
George J. Cox for fuller explanations of the formulae and technicalities
of the craft.</p>

<p><i>Source of Principles.</i> The principles herein advocated are directly
related to architectural design which is to be regarded as the standard
authority for the industrial arts designer. It was necessary to
state these principles in the form of sufficiently flexible rules which
would allow the student to use his own judgment, but at the same
time, restrict him to the essential principles of good design.</p>

<p><i>Rules.</i> This presentation of the principles of design by means of
flexible rules in concrete form, serves to vitalize design by virtue
of their immediate application to the material. The rules likewise
save time for both pupil and instructor. This is regarded as an
important factor, inasmuch as the amount of time usually allotted to
classroom teaching of design is limited.</p>

<p>While these rules are applied to the specific materials, the designer
may readily adjust them to other materials and find them equally
applicable. Direct copying of designs from the illustrations is a
dangerous expedient and is to be discouraged as a form of plagiarism
which will eventually destroy the student's initiative, originality,
and reputation for creative work.</p>

<p><i>Results</i>. From the tests so far observed, it has been seen that
under design guidance, the projects become more noticeably individual
in character, lighter and better in construction, and more fully
adjusted to their environment. The student's interest and initiative
in his work are strengthened, and he completes the truly valuable
cycle of the educative process of evolving his own idea and crystallizing
it in the completed work. It is hoped that this book will tend
to develop higher standards of good design in schools, industrial
establishments, and the home.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author expresses his thanks to the following
for their valuable suggestions and assistance in contributed illustrations:
Miss D.F. Wilson, Miss Edna Howard, Miss Elizabeth
Upham, Miss A.M. Anderson, Mr. J.M. Dorrans, Mr. J.B. Robinson,
author of "Architectural Composition," and others to whom reference
is made in the text.</p>

DIVISIONS OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS DESIGN</h2>

<div class="sidenote">Non-technical
Criticism</div>

<p>This book has been written with the view of presenting design
from the standpoint of the industrial arts. An instructor generally
experiences difficulty in finding the exact word to use when criticizing
a student's drawing. The student has equal difficulty in
understanding the criticism. There is little wonder that he is
confused, when the rather ambiguous terms "good-looking," "ugly,"
"squatty," and "stiff" are used to express qualities that can be
expressed only in terms of design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intelligent
Analysis</div>

<p>The lack of understanding between the pupil and the teacher may
be compared to the attitude of the average individual "who knows
what he likes." He is on an equally insecure footing regarding
industrial design. His reason for liking or disliking a certain thing
may depend upon some whim or fancy, the popular fashion of the
times, or a desire to possess a duplicate of something he has seen.
As a consumer with purchasing power, he should have the ability
to <i>analyze intelligently</i> the contents of catalogs and store windows
with the thought of securing the best in industrial art&mdash;something
that may be accepted as standard one hundred years from now.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, the intention to present design of industrial
character in its simplest form, freed from technicalities or ambiguous
statements. It is intended to give the average individual not particularly
interested in drawing or design a knowledge of the subject,
based upon principles that have survived for hundreds of years in
architectural monuments and history.</p>

<img src="images/i_010.jpg" width="500" height="657" alt="The First Major Division of Industrial Arts Design" />
<span class="caption smcap">Plate 1</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Results of
Clear
Criticism</div>

<p>It is possible that the presentation of these principles may enable
the instructor in the public schools to guide his pupil away from the
heavy and expensive stereotyped designs, and by clear and simple
criticism, lead him to better forms of construction. He may also be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
helped to lead the pupil to design problems in harmony with his
home surroundings and thus avoid the introduction of an inharmonious
element into what may possibly be a harmonious setting. The
teacher, pupil, or layman should use his knowledge of the subject as
a basis for criticism or appreciation of the field of the industrial arts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Requirements
of an Industrial
Problem</div>

<p>In order to start successfully upon a design, it is necessary to
know what qualities a good industrial article should possess. Whether
one is designing a bird-house, a chocolate set, or a gold pendant,
the article must meet three needs: (1) It must be of service to the
community or to the individual; (2) It must be made of some
durable material; (3) It must possess beauty of proportion, outline,
and color.</p>

<p>Ruskin said that a line of beauty must also be a line of service.
The "stream line body" in automobile construction is the result of
the automobile maker's attempt to combine beauty with service.
This is the attitude that should govern the union of beauty and
service in all of the industrial arts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions in
Design
Evolution and
Enrichment</div>

<p>There are three divisions or phases in the designing of a structure
and its enrichment. These are: (1) Structural Design;
(2) Contour Enrichment; (3) Surface Enrichment. Some objects
are carried through only one of these divisions, while others are
developed through all three of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First
Major
Division</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_1">Plate 1</a>, illustrative of the first division, deals naturally enough
with the planning of the constructive or utilitarian lines of an object
and its parts. It may be termed Structural or Constructive Design.
Questions of how high or how long an object should be, to harmonize
with its width, the proper placing of rails, shelves, and brackets,
the determination of the greatest and least diameter of vase forms
have to be decided in this period of Proportions and Space Relations.</p>

<p>The knowledge of tools and materials, and of the manner in
which they may be used for constructive purposes, influences the
solution of these questions and others which we shall shortly discuss.
Strictly utilitarian objects are seldom carried past this stage of
development.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second
Major
Division</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a> indicates the next logical division&mdash;Contour Enrichment&mdash;or
the period of the enrichment of the structural outline or contour.
The bounding lines, or contours, of the structure may be
enriched in many ways, as, for example, curving certain portions
to soften the severity of the plain structure. The garden urn and
small stool have contours treated in this manner. Chippendale,
Sheraton, and Hepplewhite furniture, simplified to the accepted
range of shop technic, vary the straight lines of mission furniture
and come within the possible developments of this division.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_2" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>

<span class="caption smcap">Plate 2</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Effects of
Second
Division</div>

<p>The cement fence post at <i>C</i>, <a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>, is a strict utilitarian problem
without interest. The post at <i>D</i>, enriched by a bevel, has equal
utilitarian and increased aesthetic interest and value.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third
Major
Division</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_3">Plate 3</a> illustrates the last division of evolution and concerns
itself with the application of design to the surface of the otherwise
complete structure. This division is commonly called applied
surface design or decorative design. It is readily seen that this
division should be considered after the structure has been carefully
planned. To separate this division from the period of structural
or contour enrichment we will call it Surface Enrichment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steps in
Design
Evolution</div>

<p>It may be seen from the foregoing discussion that a design may
be carried through the following steps: (1) Blocking in the enclosing
lines of the design, as at Figure B, <a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>, adding to this whatever
may be needed for structural purposes, keeping the lines as nearly
vertical and horizontal as possible; (2) Enriching and varying the
outline or contour. It is well for elementary wood workers to use
this step with extreme caution, while less reserve is necessary in
clay and metal; (3) After careful consideration in determining the
need of additional decoration, the last step, surface enrichment,
should be used. The following chapters will take up these steps
in the order stated above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ideal
Correlation</div>

<p>The ideal method of developing the principles set forth in this
chapter includes correlated activity in the shop by working out
the project in the required material. As the technic of the individual
improves, the larger range of design principles will be found
to accompany and parallel his increasing skill.</p>

THE PRIMARY MASS AND ITS PROPORTIONS</h2>

<div class="sidenote">The
Architectural
Method</div>

<p>Upon first observing a building, one seldom notices details of
structure. He sees the large mass as it is silhouetted against the
sky. Nearer approach discloses mouldings, cornices, and doorways;
while careful analytical study shows the technical points of construction.
The architect, in his original planning, thinks in terms
of masses, widths, and heights, disregarding at first the details and
color. As architecture stands for parent design principles and represents
some of the world's best examples of composition and design,
industrial design should be based upon the best examples of architectural
design. To a certain degree, also, the methods of the
industrial arts designer should be those of the architect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Industrial
Arts Method</div>

<p>It is necessary to think at first of our problem as a single mass
or solid, bounded by enclosing dimensions of width, height, and
thickness. Details like a mirror, handles, brackets, or knobs may
project outside of this mass, but for the time being, they may be
disregarded. Figure B, <a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>, shows this manner of thinking,
and will enable us to regard the problem as a big, simple mass so
that the entire object, unobstructed by small details, may be seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Primary
Mass</div>

<p>This is the method of <i>thinking</i> about the problem which should
precede the drawing. To further describe this mass, which will be
called the single or Primary Mass, it is necessary to think of the
intended service of the project. A rather hazy idea of making a
vase or a stool to be put to no particular use, may have been the
original motive. Now the exact service should be defined as it will
have a marked effect upon the shape of this primary mass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_4" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="500" height="660" alt="Analysis of the Primary Mass" />
<span class="caption smcap">Plate 4</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Service<br /><br />Horizontal
and Vertical
Primary
Masses</div>

<p>Rule 1a. <i>A primary mass must be either vertical or horizontal
according to the intended service, unless prohibited by technical requirements.</i>
Service is an important factor inasmuch as it limits the
intended use of the mass. A mass is horizontal when its largest
dimension is horizontal. When the horizontal dimension of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
mass is reduced until the main vertical dimension is longer than
the main horizontal one, it becomes a vertical mass.
As an example,
a davenport is generally a horizontal mass intended to hold a number
of people. When the mass is narrowed to the point where the vertical
dimension exceeds the horizontal, it becomes a chair for one
person. A low bowl may be intended for pansies, but as soon as
the service changes and we design it for goldenrod, it becomes a
vertical mass. The fable of the fox who, upon being invited to dine
with the stork, found the tall vases unfitted for his use illustrates
the change of mass with the change of service.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_4">Figures 1</a> and <a href="#Plate_4">4</a>, <a href="#Plate_4">Plate 4</a>, are examples of horizontal masses with
the dark lines indicating the dominance of the horizontal lines and
planes. The shelter house contains a long bench, making necessary
the long horizontal lines of the building. The calendar holder
has to be a horizontal mass because of the restrictions imposed by
the shape of the calendar pad.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_4">Figures 2</a> and <a href="#Plate_4">3</a> are vertical masses. The vase is intended for
tall flowers, while the chair, as has already been mentioned, must
meet the needs of a single person. Utility and service then have
been found to give the primary mass a given direction or dominance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drawing
the Primary
Mass</div>

<p>The designer now represents this mass by drawing a rectangle
similar to the block outline of Figure B, <a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>. It is now necessary
to see if the foundation stones of this rectangle have been laid correctly;
in other words, to test the proportions of the primary vertical
or horizontal mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proportions
of the
Primary
Masses</div>

<p>Rule 1b. <i>A primary mass should have the ratio of one to three,
three to four, three to five, five to eight, seven to ten, or some similar
proportion difficult for the eye to detect readily and analyze.</i> Proportions
are generally expressed in terms of ratios. A surface of five by eight
inches would give a ratio of five to eight; ten by sixteen feet is reducible
to the same ratio. Certain ratios are monotonous and offend
the eye by their lack of variety. Ratios such as one to one or one to
two are of this class and should be avoided. If these ratios
could speak they would resemble people talking in a low monotonous

ideas upon a subject they discuss. Examples in this class show
ratios of two to two and one-eighth, or three to three and one-fourth,
neither positively square nor frankly rectangular. They hide
around the corner, as it were, waiting to be anything. <a href="#Plate_5">Figure 5</a>,
<a href="#Plate_5">Plate 5</a>, is an example of unsatisfactory proportionate ratios of
the primary mass. The blotting tablet is nearly square, while the

strongly vertical masses, lack the type of definite thinking that
results in a decided vertical dimension.</p>

<p>Disregarding the improvement in technic, <a href="#Plate_5">Figure 6</a> shows problems
designed with a definite knowledge of proportion. The metal
objects are refined in their dimensions, and pleasing to the eye.
Tests have been made with the idea of determining what the eye
considers perfectly natural and agreeable proportion. This has been
found to be the ratio of two to three. Consequently, it is clear
why <a href="#Plate_5">Figure 6</a> shows objects more pleasing than those in <a href="#Plate_5">Figure 5</a>.</p>

<p>It may be felt that too much space is being given to this subject
of proportion. It should be remembered, however, that the
industrial arts are intimately associated with daily life and that
unless proportions are pleasing to our aesthetic sense, many articles
of common use shortly become intolerable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preliminary
Thinking in
Terms of
Design</div>

<p>This preliminary portion of the designer's task has been given
to thinking out the problem and drawing one rectangle. There is a
tendency to start the design by pushing the pencil over the paper
with a forlorn hope that a design may be evolved with little mental
effort. This should be regarded as illogical and unworthy of the
desired end. A rectangle of the most prominent surface of the problem,
based upon the desired service of the project, and the best
proportions which our knowledge of design and understanding of the
limitations of construction will permit, should be the final result of
the first study. From now on through the succeeding steps, the
details of the problem will become more and more clear, as the technical
limitations of the tools and materials governing the designer's
ideas and controlling and shaping the work are better understood,
until all governing factors become crystallized in the form of a
working drawing or model. This is a strictly professional practice
as illustrated in <a href="#Plate_5">Figure 7</a>, which shows the skilled Rookwood potter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
developing a vase form, the definite embodiment of correct thinking

HORIZONTAL MAJOR DIVISIONS OF
THE PRIMARY MASS</h2>


<p>In the <a href="#Chap_II">second chapter</a> we discussed the nature of the primary
mass in its relation to the intended service or duty it has to perform.
It was found that the demands of service usually cause the primary
mass to be designed with either a strong vertical or horizontal tendency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions
of the
Primary
Mass</div>

<p>It now becomes imperative to carry the designing processes still
further and divide the vertical or horizontal primary mass into
parts or divisions, demanded either by structural requirements
or because the appearance of the object would be materially improved
by their presence. This latter point is sometimes referred to as
the aesthetic requirement of the problem. There are two simple
types of divisions, those crossing the primary mass horizontally
and those crossing the primary mass in a vertical direction. This
chapter will be limited to the subject of horizontal divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature and
Need of
Horizontal
Space
Divisions</div>

<p>If a city purchases a piece of land for park purposes, presumably
a landscape architect is assigned the task of laying out the paths
and drives. He does this by crossing his plan at intervals with lines
to represent paths connecting important points. Under favorable
conditions the architect is free to curve his path to suit his ideas.
He has considerable freedom in selecting his design but the paths
or roads must dip and curve in sympathy with the contour of the
land and in accord with the aesthetic requirements.</p>

<p>While the landscape designer has a broad latitude in his treatment
of land divisions, the industrial designer or architect is restricted, on
the other hand, by the structural requirements of the object and by
his materials. He must cross his spaces or areas by horizontal
shelves, or rails, or bands of metal that hold the structure together.
As architecture is of fundamental importance in industrial design,
let us see what the architect has in mind in designing a structure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_6" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption smcap">Plate 6</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Architectural
Horizontal
Divisions</div>

<p>The architect has the surface of the ground with which to start.
This gives him a horizontal line as the base of his building. He considers
it of major importance in his design. We find him crossing
the front of his building with horizontal moulding or long bands
of colored brick, paralleling the base line and otherwise interestingly
dividing the vertical face of the front and sides. His guide is the
bottom line of his primary mass or the line of the ground which binds
the different parts of the building into a single unit. It can be readily
seen that if he shifted the position of his mouldings up or down
with the freedom of the landscape architect in locating his roads,
he would not be planning his horizontal divisions in sympathy with
the structural requirements of his primary mass.</p>

<p>These horizontal divisions or lines have a tendency to give apparent
added length to an object. Thus by their judicious use a designer
may make a building or room look longer than it really is.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the simpler objects with which we may be
more directly concerned. The piano bench has horizontal lines
crossing it, giving an effect quite similar to that of horizontal mouldings
crossing a building. There may also be ornamental inlaid
lines crossing the bench and intended to beautify the design, but it is
to be remembered that at present we are considering the <i>structural
divisions</i> only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Designing
Objects with
Horizontal
Divisions</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_6">Plate 6</a> represents a concrete example of the methods to be used
in designing the horizontal divisions of a piano bench. The steps
may be divided as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The height of a piano bench may be determined either
from measurement of a similar bench or from one of the books on
furniture design now on the market. The scale of one inch or one
and one-half inches to the foot may be adopted. Two horizontal
lines should be drawn, one for the bottom and one for the top of
the bench. The distance between these lines we will arbitrarily
fix at twenty inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_7" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="500" height="662" alt="Applied and Constructive Design. Principle 1. Principle 2" />
<span class="caption smcap">Plate 7</span>
</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Many objects are designed within rectangles which enclose
their main or over-all proportions. With this in view, and keeping
in mind the width of the bench necessary to the accommodation of
two players and the requirements of a well proportioned primary
mass (Rule 1b), the lines are now drawn completing the rectangular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
boundaries of the primary mass. The limitations of service and
the restrictions of good designing give the width of the primary
mass so designed as three feet and two inches, with a ratio of height
to length of five to eight and one-half. It is simpler to design first
the most prominent face of the object to be followed by other views
later in the designing process.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) By observing benches similar to the one being designed it
will be seen that the horizontal divisions will take the form of a rail
and a shelf, making two crossings of the primary mass dividing it into
three horizontal spaces. Several trial arrangements of these structural
elements are now made with the thought of making them
conform to the rule governing three horizontal spaces. Rule 2b.
We shall later discuss this rule and its applications fully.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) By selecting the best sketch of many which the designer
will make he has the basis for the application of Rule 2b for the structural
elements. The project now begins to take on concrete form.
The top board may project slightly beyond the primary mass without
materially affecting the value of the designed proportions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of a
Full Size
Drawing</div>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The last step is the designing of the side view in relation
to the front view. This enables the designer to comprehend the
project as a whole. It is strongly urged that the final or shop
drawing be of full size. In more elaborate designs the finer proportions
are lost in the process of enlargement from a small sketch,
often hurriedly executed in the shop. Again much time is lost by
necessary enlargement, whereas a full size curved detail may be
quickly transferred to wood by carbon paper or by holes pricked in
the paper. It is not expensive or difficult to execute full size drawings;
it is in accord with shop practice and the custom should be
encouraged and followed on all possible occasions. See <a href="#Fig_102a">Figure 102a</a>.</p>

<p>The process of designing round objects is identical to that just
described as illustrated by the low round bowl in <a href="#Plate_7">Plate 7</a>. It should
be designed in a rectangle of accepted proportions. Rule 1b. The
primary mass may have excellent proportions and yet the vase or
bowl may remain devoid of interest. It may be commonplace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_8" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="500" height="664" alt="Horizontal Space Divisions of the Primary Mass in Wood" />
<span class="caption smcap">Plate 8</span>
</div>

<p>As will shortly be shown, the rules governing horizontal divisions
serve as a check on the commonplace. A horizontal division generally
marks the point where the outward swell of the vase contour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
reaches its maximum width. If this widest point in the primary
mass (X-<a href="#Plate_7">Plate 7</a>) is pleasingly located between the top and bottom
of a vase form the contour will be found satisfactory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Architectural
Precedent for
Horizontal
Divisions</div>

<p>It is possible to continue <i>ad infinitum</i> with these illustrations
but horizontal space divisions are nearly always present in some
form, due to structural necessity or aesthetic requirements. It is an
easy matter to say that these lines must divide the primary mass into
"interesting" spaces, well related to each other, or "pleasingly
located," but the designer must have some definite yet flexible rule
to govern his work. From the analysis of many famous historic
buildings and well designed industrial projects it has been found
that all horizontal masses may be analyzed as dividing the primary
mass into either <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> divisions or spaces, regardless of the
complexity of the project.</p>


<h3 class="section">Analysis of Horizontal Space Divisions</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Two
Horizontal
Space
Divisions</div>

<p>Rule 2a. <i>If the primary mass is divided into two horizontal divisions,
the dominance should be either in the upper or the lower section.</i>
<a href="#Plate_7">Plate 7</a> shows this division of the primary mass&mdash;the simplest
division of the space. A space divided just half way from top to
bottom would be monotonous and expressive of the ratio of one
to one. This arrangement as we have already discovered in the
<a href="#Chap_II">second chapter</a> is not conducive to good design.</p>

<p>By the stated rule, 2a, the varied adjustment of this double
horizontal division affords all possible latitude for constructive
purposes. It is better to place the division in such a manner that
the upper division (or lower) will not appear pinched or dwarfed
by comparison with the remaining area. Thus a ratio of one to
three, or three to five, or five to eight is better than a ratio of one to
one or one to eighteen, but there is no exact or arbitrary ruling
on this point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two

<p><a href="#Plate_8">Figure 8</a> illustrates two horizontal divisions in wood construction
and also the freedom of choice as to exact proportions. The eye
will be found a good judge of the proper spacings subject to the
limitations already mentioned.</p>

<p>It is best to keep the design within the limits of two horizontal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
space divisions in designing cylindrical clay forms, particularly
in the elementary exercises. Enough variety will be found to make
pleasing arrangements, and the technical results obtained by two
divisions are much better than those obtained from a greater number
of divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two

<p><a href="#Plate_9">Figures 14</a>, <a href="#Plate_9">15</a>, and <a href="#Plate_9">16</a>, <a href="#Plate_9">Plate 9</a>, are clay forms with the dominance
placed in either the upper or lower portion of the primary mass.
<a href="#Plate_9">Figure 13</a> has been used to illustrate the fact that horizontal space
division principles are applicable to any material. The horizontal
divisions in <a href="#Plate_9">Figure 13</a> are due to structural needs. A horizontal
line carries this division across to <a href="#Plate_9">Figure 14</a>, a clay vase. The
horizontal division line now becomes the one which marks the
widest part of the vase. It gives the same relation between the
top and bottom horizontal spaces as in <a href="#Plate_9">Figure 13</a>. It marks an
aesthetic point in the design of the vase, or a variation of the contour,
introduced by reason of its effect upon the beauty of the vase, not
called for by the needs of actual service.</p>

<p>A musical composition is often played in an orchestra first by
the wood instruments, taken up and repeated by the brasses, then by
the strings, and finally played as an harmonious whole by the entire
orchestra. There is a close parallel in <a href="#Plate_9">Figure 12</a>, an adaptation of
one of Gustav Stickley's designs. The two-division rule is used
in the relations of the plaster and wainscoting; again in the plaster
over, and the cement or tile around the fireplace. It is repeated in
the arrangement of the copper and cement of the fireplace facing
and hood and in the door panels. By repeating again and again
similar space divisions the wall space becomes a unified and harmonious
whole. Variety is secured by the introduction of three horizontal
divisions in the details of the wainscoting. This method of repeating
similar space divisions is called "echoing" and is one of the most
effective means known for securing the effect of <i>unity</i>.</p>

<a href="#Plate_10">Figures 17</a>, <a href="#Plate_10">18</a>, and <a href="#Plate_10">19</a>, <a href="#Plate_10">Plate 10</a>, are examples of such divisions. The
location of the clock face in <a href="#Plate_10">Figure 18</a> calls for the placing of its
horizontal axis in accordance with Rule 2a. The lamp in <a href="#Plate_10">Figure
19</a> shows an instance where the entire design once divided by Rule 2a,
may be again subdivided into a similar series of divisions. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
arrangement is quite similar to the system of repetitions seen in
<a href="#Plate_9">Figure 12</a> and termed "echoing" the original divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
Horizontal
Space
Divisions</div>

<p>Rule 2b. <i>If the primary mass is divided into three horizontal
divisions or sections, the dominance should be placed in the center
section with varying widths in the upper and lower thirds.</i></p>

<p>When it becomes necessary to divide the primary mass into more
than two sections the designer's problem becomes more difficult.
With the addition of a greater number of horizontal divisions there
is a manifest tendency for the design to become cut up into so many
small sections that the simplicity of the whole mass is lost. Here, as
elsewhere, that principle which we call <i>unity</i> or the quality of "holding
together" is necessary and should be the constant test of the design.
The instant any part of the design seems to fly apart from the main
mass it becomes the designer's duty to simplify the design or pull the
parts together and thus restore the lost unity.</p>

<p>As a restriction against loss of unity it is necessary to group all
of the minor horizontal divisions into a system of two or three large
horizontal divisions. Referring to Rule 2b, it is seen that when three
divisions are used, it becomes the practice to accentuate the center
section by making it larger. This arrangement is designed to give
weight to the center portion and by this big stable division to hold
the other subdivisions together and in unity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
Horizontal
Divisions
in Wood</div>

<p>Two horizontal masses and one vertical mass shown in <a href="#Plate_8">Figures
9</a>, <a href="#Plate_8">10</a>, and <a href="#Plate_8">11</a>, <a href="#Plate_8">Plate 8</a>, illustrate the application of this three-division
rule to wood construction. It is seen that the construction of rails,
doors, and shelves is responsible for the fixing of all of these divisions.
It may also be seen that three divisions are applicable to either the
vertical or the horizontal primary mass. <a href="#Plate_8">Figure 10</a> illustrates the
violation of this type of spacing at the point <i>A</i>, where the shelves
are no more pleasingly arranged than the rounds of a ladder. Later
on we shall be able to rearrange these shelves in a pleasing manner
but at present it is better to relieve the monotony by omitting the
center shelf. This applies the three division rule to the satisfactory
appearance of the desk at <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>Similar monotony in spacing is seen in the screen, <a href="#Plate_8">Figure 11</a>.
The correction in <i>B</i> appeals at once as a far more satisfactory arrangement
than that secured by placing the cross bar half way up as in <i>A</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
There are no infallible rules for this readjustment beyond those
already stated. The eye must in part be depended upon to guide
the artistic sense aright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
Horizontal
Divisions
in Clay</div>

<p>It is suggested that it is desirable to keep clay forms within the
limitations of two divisions. Rectangular posts, pedestals, and
other vertical forms in cement may be developed by the application
of Rule 2a or 2b, if care is taken to group all minor divisions well
within the limitations of these rules.</p>

<p>The statement just made in reference to simplified groupings is
illustrated in the candlestick and cup in <a href="#Plate_10">Figures 20</a> and <a href="#Plate_10">21</a>, <a href="#Plate_10">Plate 10</a>.
The construction based upon the three functions performed by the
cup, the handle, and the base, suggests the use of these horizontal
divisions. The minor curves have been subordinated to,
and kept within, these three divisions. The final result gives a
distinct feeling of unity impossible under a more complex grouping.
The Greek column will afford an architectural illustration of a similar
grouping system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
Horizontal

in Metal</div>

<p>The lathe bed of <a href="#Plate_10">Figure 22</a> shows one of innumerable examples
of space violations in the industrial arts. A slight lowering of
the cross brace would add materially to the appearance and strength
of the casting. <a href="#Plate_10">Figure 23</a> is a copper box with the following more or
less common faults of design: commonplace ratio of length and
width (2:1) partially counteracted, however, by a more pleasing
ratio of the vertical dimension, equal spacing in the width of cover
of box and box body, and equal spacing of the hinges of the box
from the ends of the box and from each other. By applying the
two and three horizontal division rules these errors may be
avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freehand

<p><a href="#Plate_10">Figure 24</a> shows a low bowl with a compass curve used in designing
the contour. This has brought the widest part of the design in the
exact center of the bowl which makes it commonplace. In addition
to this the top and bottom are of the same width, lacking variety
in this respect. Correction is readily made by applying a freehand
curve to the contour, raising or lowering the widest point (<i>F</i>), at
the same time designing the bottom either larger or smaller than
the top.</p>

VERTICAL MAJOR DIVISIONS OF
THE PRIMARY MASS</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Nature
and Need of
Vertical
Space
Division</div>

<p>The design of the primary mass has now been considered under
Rules 1a and 1b, and its horizontal divisions under Rules 2a
and 2b. The next logical step is the consideration of the nature of
the lines that cross the primary mass in a vertical direction. In the
original planning of the primary mass it was found that the horizontal
bounding lines and the horizontal divisions were parallel to
the base line of an object and that the base line was necessary to
ensure stability. Vertical lines are necessary and equally important
to give the needed vertical support to an object.</p>

<p>So accustomed is the eye to vertical lines in tree trunks, tall
buildings, and thousands of other examples that the upward eye
movement in viewing an object, having a predominance of vertical
elements, seemingly adds to its height.</p>

<p>The designer thus has a most useful device with which to increase
the apparent height of an object that, for structural or other reasons,
must in reality not have great height. <a href="#Chap_III">Chapter III</a> drew attention
to the influence of horizontal lines on a project. Vertical lines on an
object are found to produce an analogous effect vertically.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Architectural
Precedent
for
Vertical
Divisions</div>

<p>Gothic cathedral builders used the vertical line, repeated again
and again in buttresses, pinnacles, and spires to give great apparent
height to a building and to make it a unified vertical mass of great
beauty. The modern church spire, together with the long, vertical
interior columns, similarly affects our present day church edifices.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_12" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>

<span class="caption smcap">Plate 12</span>
</div>

<p>This idea of repeating the vertical bounding lines of the primary
mass by cutting the mass into vertical spaces is also useful in breaking
up or destroying the monotony of large unbroken surfaces. Pilasters
may cut the front of a building into interesting spaces; piers may
break up the regularity of a long fence; legs and panels may, each

for the same purpose, cross a cabinet. While some of these may be
structurally necessary and some not, they are all witnesses to the
desire to produce beauty in design. As these examples are so
numerous in the industrial arts, it is well to study in detail their
proper adaptation to our needs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One
Vertical
Space
Division</div>

<p>Upon analyzing one vertical space division, it will be found to be a
primary mass, vertical in character and governed by Rule 1a. <a href="#Plate_12">Figure
25</a>, <a href="#Plate_12">Plate 12</a>, illustrates one vertical division. The foot is an
appendage to be considered in <a href="#Chap_V">Chapter V</a>.</p>

<p>Rule 3a. <i>If the primary mass is divided into two vertical divisions,
the divisions should be equal in area and similar in form.</i> Exception
may be made in case of structural requirements. By imagining
two adjacent doors of equal size, the design effect of two vertical
divisions may be made clear. <a href="#Plate_11">Plate 11</a> illustrates a rectangle (<i>A</i>)
divided in this manner, preliminary to the development of a problem.
<a href="#Plate_12">Figure 27</a>, <a href="#Plate_12">Plate 12</a>, represents the type of object to which
the exception to the rule may be applied. In the design of this
desk, the structure practically prohibits two equal vertical divisions,
necessitating an unequal division in the section occupied by the
drawers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
Vertical
Space
Divisions</div>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_12">Plate 12</a>, <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 26</a>, the designer had his vertical spacings
dictated by service in the form of two doors. As service demands a
tall vertical primary mass, it is but natural to design the doors to
conform with the primary mass. This gives a monotonously long
space for the glass panels and suggests structural weakness. To
relieve this the designer applied Rule 2a and crossed the vertical
panels by horizontal subdivisions, relieving the monotony and still
retaining the unity of the primary mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
Vertical
Divisions
in Wood</div>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 27</a> his problem was a variation of that presented in
<a href="#Plate_12">Figure 26</a>. Structural limitations called for unequal divisions of the
vertical space arrangement. The left portion of the desk becomes
dominant as demanded by service. The drawer or brace is necessary
in this design as it acts as a sort of link, binding the two vertical
legs together. The omission of the drawer would destroy the unity
of the mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
Vertical
Divisions
in Clay</div>

<p>As vertical space divisions are principally applicable to rectilinear
or flat objects and moreover as it is in such forms only that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
have structural value, they are not commonly met in cylindrical
pottery ware. Vertical divisions are, however, occasionally used in
architectural tiles and other flat wall objects. As three divisions
are much more commonly used in clay and cement, this material
will now be left for later consideration in this chapter.</p>

<p>Vertical spacings in metal are quite similar to space divisions in
wood. Wrought iron fences are, by reason of structural limitations
composed of vertical and horizontal lines, varied by the introduction
of piers and curved members. As they are typical of a certain
branch of iron construction, two designs of the Anchor Post Iron
Company have been introduced. <a href="#Plate_14">Figure 32</a>, <a href="#Plate_14">Plate 14</a>, represents
two equal vertical divisions made so because of structural and
aesthetic demands. The piers in this instance form a part of the
general design of the entire gate and must be considered accordingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vertical
Divisions
in Metal</div>

<p>The vertical subdivision in <a href="#Plate_14">Figure 32</a>, <a href="#Plate_14">Plate 14</a>, has been repeated
or echoed by the long vertical bars, alternating with the shorter ones
and producing pleasing variety. The horizontal divisions are
designed according to Rule 2b. In designing the newel lantern in
<a href="#Plate_14">Figure 34</a> the designer was required to form a vertical primary
mass to conform with the similar mass of the post. This he determined
to subdivide vertically in practically the same manner as
the cabinet in <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 26</a>. Threatened with the same monotony he
met the situation by subdividing the vertical sections into three
horizontal divisions in accordance with Rule 2b. The structural
supports, however, rising up in the center of this mass, destroy
its unity. They would have carried out the lines of the structure
of the newel post and continued the lines of the lantern better, if
they had been attached to the corners rather than to the sides of
the newel post.</p>

<p>Rule 3b. <i>If the primary mass is divided into three vertical divisions,
the center division should be the larger, with the remaining divisions
of equal size.</i> A large building with a wing on either side will give
an idea of this form of spacing. The size of the main building holds
the wings to it, thus preserving the unity of the structure, while equal
divisions on either side give balance. <a href="#Plate_11">Plate 11</a> (<i>B</i>) gives an example
of a rectangle divided in this manner. This three-division motive
is a very old one. In the middle ages painters and designers used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
three divisions or a triptych, as it is called, in their altar decorations.
A painting of the Virgin was usually placed in the center division
with a saint in each of the remaining panels to the right and left.
Designers and mural decorators have been using the triptych ever
since that period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three

Divisions
in Wood</div>

<p>The desk in <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 28</a>, <a href="#Plate_12">Plate 12</a>, is a good example of the three-vertical
space rule. The drawer in the center forms the mid or
dominant section and by its greater length holds the two smaller
sections together. This design is better than <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 27</a>, which has a
similar mass. The prominent vertical lines in <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 27</a> counteract
and destroy the effect of the long horizontal dominant lines of the
table top, whereas in <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 28</a>, the vertical lines in the center of the
design are so short that they do not interfere with the horizontal
lines of the table top. <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 28</a> supports the horizontal tendency
of the primary mass while <a href="#Plate_12">Figure 27</a> neutralizes or practically
destroys its character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three

in Clay
and Cement</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_13">Figure 30</a>, <a href="#Plate_13">Plate 13</a>, represents an overmantle by the Rookwood
Potteries. It is typical of a class of overmantles which may be developed
in tiles or in cement, forming an agreeable contrast with the
brick of a large fireplace. The three divisions or triptych should be
proportionately related to the opening of the fireplace and to the
enclosing mass of brick or wood work. We will consider <a href="#Plate_13">Figure 29</a>
to show how this may be carried out.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_13">Figure 29</a> bears a strong resemblance to <a href="#Plate_9">Figure 12</a>, <a href="#Plate_9">Plate 9</a>, and
is an elaboration of a simple three-division theme of spacing. The
design seems to be complex until it is analyzed into two rules. The
primary mass of the entire fireplace motive (including the surrounding
panelling) has first been planned with strong and prominent
horizontal lines. This was then divided vertically (<i>A</i>) to conform
with Rule 3b, the three-division theme, giving the divisions for the
bookcases and mantle. The horizontal divisions (<i>B</i>) were then
constructed within the remaining space, affecting the distance from
the picture moulding to the mantle and from the mantle to the floor
line, in accordance with Rule 2a. That left the space of the width
of the cement work (<i>C</i>) to be subdivided again by Rule 3b, while the
top of the wainscoting panels re-echoed the previous horizontal
divisions of Rule 2a. The fireplace opening merely carries out at <i>D</i>
the same proportionate relation that dominates all vertical divisions,
Rule 3b, while the wainscoting follows the general horizontal divisions
of Rule 2a. By this method we have variety in spacing and unity
through repetition of similar proportions.</p>

The cement bench, <a href="#Plate_13">Figure 31</a>, has a three-division arrangement

<div class="sidenote">Three
Vertical
Divisions
in Metal</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_14">Figure 33</a>, <a href="#Plate_14">Plate 14</a>, is a common example of three vertical
divisions in metal suggested by the needs of service. <a href="#Plate_14">Figures 35</a>
and <a href="#Plate_14">36</a> are thin metal problems. The familiar pen tray is primarily
a horizontal mass, so determined by its required service as a pen
holder. The projecting handles form the outer divisions, and the
spacing motive, Rule 3b, has been repeated in the raised projection,
decorating the handles. The book rack in <a href="#Plate_14">Figure 36</a> is an example
of the manner in which a nearly square mass, so designed for structural
reasons, may, by Rules 3b and 2a, be broken into a fairly
pleasing arrangement of divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More Than
Three
Divisions</div>

<p>Rule 3c. <i>In elementary problems, if more than three vertical
divisions are required, they should be so grouped as to analyze into
Rules 3a and 3b, or be exactly similar.</i> The eye becomes confused
by a multitude of vertical divisions and it is much better designing
to keep them within the number stated in this chapter. There are
instances, however, when this is impossible. Under such conditions
the following treatment should be adopted:</p>

<p>Unless, as stated, a large number of vertical divisions may be
grouped into two or three vertical divisions it is better to make all
of the divisions of the same size. This does not fatigue the eye as
much as would the introduction of a number of complex spacings.
This solution enables the amateur designer to deal with complex
problems with an assurance of securing a degree of unity.</p>

APPENDAGES AND RULES GOVERNING THEM</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Use of the
Appendage</div>

<p>An appendage is a member added to the primary mass for utilitarian
purposes. In the industrial arts, when an appendage is added
merely for the purpose of decoration, it is as useless and functionless
as the human appendix and, as a source of discord, should be removed.</p>

<p>An appendage in industrial arts may be, among other things,
a plate rail, bracket, spout, cover, or handle, all of which are capable
of service either for or with the primary mass. In architecture it
may be a wing or ell added to the mass of the building. Simple as
its design may seem, it is often so placed in relation to the main or
primary mass that it does not seem to "fit" or to be in unity with
that mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Designing
an
Appendage</div>

<p>Rule 4a. <i>The appendage should be designed in unity with, and
proportionately related to, the vertical or horizontal character of the
primary mass, but subordinated to it.</i></p>

<p>Rule 4b. <i>The appendage should have the appearance of flowing
smoothly and, if possible, tangentially from the primary mass.</i></p>

<p>Rule 4c. <i>The appendage should, if possible, echo or repeat some
lines similar in character and direction to those of the primary mass.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Violations of
Appendage
Design</div>

<p>All of the foregoing rules are intended to promote the sense of
unity between the primary mass and its appendages. If a mirror
on a dresser looks top-heavy it is generally due to the fact that it has
not been subordinated in size to the primary mass. Rule 4a. If the
handle projects from the primary mass of an object similar to the
handle on a pump, it has not been designed in accordance with
Rules 4b and 4c. Again, if the appendage projects from a primary
mass like a tall chimney from a long flat building, it has violated
Rule 4a and has not been proportionately related to the character
of the vertical or horizontal proportions of the primary mass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_16" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="500" height="658" alt="Examples of Appendages in Class 1 (Wood) Added to the Primary Mass for Utilitarian Purposes" />
<span class="caption smcap">Plate 16</span>
</div>

<p>It should be readily seen that if the primary mass has one dominant
proportion while the appendage has another, there will be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
serious clash and the final result will be the neutralization of both
motives, resulting in either an insipid and characterless design or a
downright lack of unity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appendages
in Wood</div>

<p>The design of the small dressing table, <a href="#Plate_16">Figure 37</a>, <a href="#Plate_16">Plate 16</a>, with
the mirror classing as an appendage, is an excellent illustration of
Rule 4a. The main mass of the table is vertical in character and the
mirror carries out or repeats the character of the primary mass by
having a similar but subordinate vertical mass. In this instance it is
so large that it has nearly the effect of a second primary mass.</p>

<p>As tangential junctions are difficult to arrange in wood construction
and particularly in furniture, the break between the table top
and the mirror has been softened by the introduction of a bracket
or connecting link. The curves of the link cause the eye to move
freely from the primary mass to the appendage and thus there is a
sense of oneness or unity between the two masses.</p>

<p>The lantern in <a href="#Plate_16">Figure 38</a> becomes an appendage and is subordinated
to the large pedestal or support. The tangential junction
has in this case been fully possible and the eye moves freely from the
vertical lines of the base to the similar vertical mass of the lantern
without noticeable break.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unifying
Appendage
and Primary
Mass</div>

<p>The service of the dressing table, <a href="#Plate_16">Figure 39</a>, with its three-division
mirror makes the problem of adaptation of the appendage
to the mass of the table, in accordance with the rules, much more
difficult. Under the circumstances, about the best that can be done,
at the same time keeping within the limitations of desired service, is
to plan the mirrors in accordance with Rule 3b, with the dominant
section in the center. To secure an approach to unity, each section
of the mirror should echo the vertical proportion of the primary
mass of the table.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 41a</p>
</div>

<p>The top of the writing stand, in <a href="#Plate_16">Figure 40</a>, is an example of a
horizontal appendage which repeats the horizontal character of the
front or typical face of the primary mass of the table. The small
drawers and divisions again take up and repeat the horizontal
motive of the table, while the entire appendage may be subdivided
under Rule 3b, giving the dominance to the center portion. The
short curves in the appendage all tend to lead the eye in a satisfactory
and smooth transition from one mass to the other or from the table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
top to the appendage. The proportions of the small drawers are
similar to the proportions of the table drawers. Rule 4c. All of
these points of similarity bring the masses into close unity or oneness
of appearance.</p>

<p>The table legs, in <a href="#Plate_16">Figure 41</a>, are more difficult to adjust satisfactorily.
The idea of the designer is, however, apparent. The
legs leave the column of the table with a tangential curve and,
sweeping out with a strong curve, repeat the horizontal line of the
table top in the horizontal lines of their bottom surfaces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Industrial
Applications</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_41a">Figure 41a</a>, a modification of <a href="#Plate_16">Figure 39</a>, shows close unity between
the three divisions of the mirror due to the pleasing curve of the center
section with its tendency to bind the other sections to it. Again,
the echoing of the spacings of the three drawers in the similar spacings
of the three mirrors, makes the bond of unity still closer to the
ideal arrangement. Rule 4c.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_41b">Figures 41b</a> and <a href="#Fig_41b">41c</a> are, in a way, parallel to <a href="#Plate_16">Figure 41</a>. The
eye moves freely from the feet (appendages) along the smooth and
graceful curves to the tall shaft or column of the primary mass. The
turned fillets, introduced at the junction of the appendage and the
primary mass, in <a href="#Fig_41c">Figure 41c</a>, have a tendency to check this smooth
passage making the arrangement in <a href="#Fig_41b">Figure 41b</a> preferable. The
hardware for the costumers is well chosen and in sympathy with the
vertical proportions of the design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appendages
in Clay</div>

<p>With the word "clay" all difficulties in the treatment of appendages
vanish. It is by far the easiest medium for the adaptation of
the appendage to the primary mass. Covers, handles, and spouts
are a few of the more prominent parts falling under this classification.</p>

<p>The process of the designer is to create the primary rectangle,
subdivide it into two horizontal subdivisions in accordance with
Rule 2a, and proceed to add the desired number of appendages.
The result may be suggested by the following illustrations. In
<a href="#Plate_17">Figure 43</a>, <a href="#Plate_17">Plate 17</a>, the cover is a continuation of the curve of the
top of the bowl, Rule 4a; the tops of the handles are continuations
of the horizontal line in the top contour of the bowl, while the lower
portions of the handles seem to spring or grow from the lower part
of the bowl with a tangential curve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Covers,
Spouts, and
Handles</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_17">Figure 44</a> is a horizontal primary mass with the horizontal
subdivision in the upper section of that mass. The spout and
handle spring naturally from the body and balance each other in
proportion, while the cover handle rises smoothly from the primary
mass. The horizontal character of the primary mass is consistently
carried out in the appendages.</p>

<p>The handle, in <a href="#Plate_17">Figure 45</a>, leaving the body at a tangent, rises
with a long straight curve to turn suddenly and join the pitcher in
harmony with its top. The apparent abruptness of the junction is
softened by the rounded corners typical of clay construction.</p>

<p>The Rookwood set, <a href="#Plate_17">Figure 42</a>, represents three similar primary
masses. The proportionate ratios and the horizontal subdivisions
are the same throughout. The handle for the teapot has been curved
in the center to give variety to the handle. This variation is a
difficult thing to manage without consequent loss of unity as by this
variation Rule 4a is violated. One thing may be said in its favor.
It brings the hand closer to the spout and thus supports the pouring
weight. But the unusual in design is to be discouraged until sufficient
skill in simple designing has been acquired.</p>

<p>In designing handle appendages for clay, they should be so placed
that they readily control the weight of the material in the container
and afford room for the fingers. Thus, it is better to have the larger
portion of the handle opening at the top of the primary mass. The
spout in all instances should continue sufficiently high to allow the
container to be filled to its full capacity without danger of the contents
running out of the spout. The glaze runs into rounded corners
much more freely than into square ones, hence it is preferable to use
rounded corners wherever possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Requirements
for
Appendage
Design<br /><br /><br />Freehand Curves</div>

<p>It is the unexpected curve that is welcome in all designing,
provided it supports the structure and conforms to established rules.
After completing a design involving appendages it should be checked
from three points of view; (1) service, (2) unity between the primary
mass and the appendages, and (3) variety of curvature. On this last
point it is needless to say that compass curves are not desirable
except in rounding small corners or in using fillets. It is well known
that compass curves are difficult to assimilate into pleasing tangential
effects. They are inclined to be monotonous and regular with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
"made by the thousand" appearance to them. One should trust
to freehand sweeps, drawn freely with a full arm movement when
possible. All curves should spring naturally from the primary
mass. Blackboard drawing is excellent practice for the muscles
used in this type of designing. In a short time it will be found
possible to produce the useful long, rather flat curve with its sudden
turn (the curve of force) that will make the compass curve tame
and commonplace by comparison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appendages
in Metal</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_18">Figures 55</a>, <a href="#Plate_18">56</a>, and <a href="#Plate_18">57</a>, <a href="#Plate_18">Plate 18</a>, show the close bond between
the appearance of the appendage in clay, and the one in metal.
While it is technically more difficult to adapt metal to the rules
governing appendages than is the case with clay, the final results are,
in most instances, equally pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p>In most of the figures showing examples in metal, the appendages
have to be secured to the primary mass by screws, rivets, or solder,
whereas in clay they may be moulded <i>into</i> the primary mass. This
tends to secure a more unified appearance; but in metal, the junction
of the handle and the primary mass is often made a decorative
feature of the design and gives added interest and variety to the
project.</p>

<p>The simple primary mass, <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 58</a>, has a horizontal space
division in the lower portion of the mass. This point of variation of
the contour has been used in the primary masses in <a href="#Plate_18">Figures 55</a>, <a href="#Plate_18">56</a>,
and <a href="#Plate_18">57</a>, also as the starting point of that dominant appendage, the
handle. Springing tangentially from the body, it rises in a straight
line of extreme value in service, then with a slight turn it parallels
and joins the top of the bowl, thus fulfilling the design functions of
an appendage from both points of service and beauty. The spout
and lid, <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 55</a>, may be likewise analyzed.</p>

of the design. The handles in the parts of the fire set, <a href="#Plate_18">Figures 48</a>
and <a href="#Plate_18">49</a>, offer different problems. It is difficult to analyze the latter
figures to determine the appendages as they are in such thorough
unity with the handles and are practically subdivisions of the
primary mass. But referring to the rule stating the fact that the
appendages are subordinated to and attached to the primary mass,
it may justly be stated that the shovel portion of the design may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
legitimately be classed as an appendage. This will explain the need
of a curve at the junction points and the feature of the decorative
twists in <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 49</a>. Both designs may be analyzed into three horizontal
divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Andiron
Design</div>

<p>The andirons, <a href="#Plate_18">Figures 50</a> to <a href="#Plate_18">53</a>, illustrate interesting transitions
in wrought iron from the primary mass to the appendage. The
vertical shaft of wrought iron has been treated as a primary mass
while the feet may be classed as appendages. In <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 50</a> we have
an example of a frankly square junction point. <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 51</a> discloses
a weld with rounded corners, forming a more pleasing junction than
does the abrupt angle of <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 50</a>. This conforms to Rule 4b.
The appendage legs echo or repeat the vertical lines of the primary
mass and there is consequently a sense of unity between them.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 52</a> the appendage foot is curved, and the primary
mass has a similar curve on the top of the vertical column to apply
Rule 4c to repeat the curve. The small links at <i>X</i> indicate an attempt
to make the junction point more pleasing to the eye, but the link
is too large to accomplish the desired result successfully. In <a href="#Plate_18">Figure
53</a> the links have been materially reduced in size and in the amount
of curvature. In this example the eye goes unhampered from
appendage to primary or back again, without perceptible interruption
and the unity of the mass, seriously threatened in <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 52</a>,
is restored in <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 53</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 46</a> there is an example of a link becoming large enough
to be classed as an appendage connecting two primary masses, <i>e.g.</i>,
the lantern and the wall. Under these conditions, one end of the
appendage harmonizes with the lantern and the other end with the
wall. <a href="#Plate_18">Figure 47</a> shows a cast brass candlestick which is an excellent
example, from the Studio, of tangential junction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of
Tools and
Materials</div>

<p>Clay may readily stand as the most adaptable material for
appendages, with metal ranking second, and wood third. The grain
of wood seems to interfere with the tangential junction of the appendage
and primary mass. Appendages of wood are, however, quite
necessary at times. Their use is merely a matter of lessening the
contrast of conflicting lines in an addition of this nature.</p>

<p>The band and bracket saws are required in many instances to
construct the connecting link between opposing masses of wood.
Hand building or casting is the means used to construct the appendages
in plastic materials. Appendages in cement are seen in the
uprights for cement seats and are generally translated into the
primary mass by means of mouldings or curves.</p>

<p>Forging or thin and raised metal construction affords many
examples of the adaptability of material in constructing appendages.
Rivets form decorative features at the junction points and should
be placed with great care and relation to the decoration and the point
of tangency.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTION SHEET FOR CLASS PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>The typical views to be used in classroom work, with the ordinary range
of problems, are shown on <a href="#Plate_19">Plate 19</a>. These typical views should be supplemented
by dimensions, cross sections, and other views whenever necessary.
Wood construction has been omitted from this sheet, but its development in
design is quite similar to the steps indicated in the summary.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF DESIGN STEPS</h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Draw the primary rectangle.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Subdivide the rectangle into two or three horizontal and, if necessary,
vertical divisions.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Estimate the dimensions of the appendage necessary to perform the desired
service in the best manner.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) If the appendage is a handle, place it in such a position that it not only
appears to but actually does support the weight of the primary mass.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Complete the contour curves of the primary mass based upon the horizontal
division which acts as a unit of measurement or a turning point.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Join the appendages to the primary mass by means of tangential curves.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Establish unity between the primary mass and the appendages by applying
Rules 4a, 4b, and 4c.</p>

members of one set.</p>

<p>Design a sideboard 3 feet 3 inches high with plate rack, the design to contain
two vertical and two horizontal divisions exclusive of the appendage.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF RULES</h3>

<p>Rule 4a. <i>The appendage should be designed in unity with, and proportionately
related to, the vertical or horizontal character of the primary mass, but subordinated
to it.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>

ENRICHMENT OF THE CONTOURS OR OUTLINES
OF DESIGNS IN WOOD</h2>


<p>With this chapter we introduce contour enrichment, the second
major division of industrial arts design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need and
Value of
Enrichment</div>

<p>A critic of furniture designed by the average manual arts student
has stated frankly that while it might have been honestly constructed
it was, in the first place, too heavy for a woman to move about the
house and, in the second place, it represented a decidedly uneconomical
use of that valuable material, wood. That there is a basis in
fact for this statement cannot be denied. Is it true, then, that
furniture must of necessity be clumsy and heavy when it is sufficiently
simplified in constructive processes for school work? We may say
emphatically, "No!"</p>

<p>One may correct the proportions of an object and reduce the size
of the materials in it to a minimum but still fail to secure the desirable
elements of lightness and interest. The object may still <i>look</i> heavy
and remain a box-like structure void of the grace synonymous with
the best in design. It is, however, possible to correct the clumsy
and heavy appearances by imparting to the design elements of grace
and lightness. Two methods may be used, singly or together:
(1) Enrichment of the Functional Outlines or Contours; (2) Surface
Enrichment sometimes called Space Filling. These may be roughly
classified respectively as three and two dimension enrichment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contour
Enrichment</div>

<p>The first, or outline enrichment, concerns itself with the structural
lines. As all designing processes should start with the structure,
it will be our policy to do so. The present chapter will deal only
with enrichment of outlines of wood projects.</p>

<p>Rule 5a. <i>Outline enrichment should be subordinated to and support
the structure.</i></p>

<p>Rule 5b. <i>Outline enrichment should add grace, lightness, and
variety to the design.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_19a" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="500" height="666" alt="Common Errors in Contour Enrichment" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> 19a</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Purpose of
Contour
Enrichment</div>

<p>It is the purpose of enrichment to add to the problem (1) grace;
(2) lightness; (3) variety; (4) unity. If it is applied in a proper
manner it should likewise add to the apparent structural strength.
We should carefully guard the design, therefore, against (1) enrichment
that has a tendency to obscure or destroy the structural lines;
in other words, enrichment that is not subordinated to the structure,
and (2) enrichment that adds nothing to the structure by its application;
that is, one which does not increase either the apparent
strength or the beauty of the object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Requirements
of Contour
Enrichment</div>

<p>As an example of this first point, the turned candlestick with the
candle supported by a stack of turned balls alternating with tauri
or thin discs tends to obscure completely the sense of support. Again,
the landscape gardener feels that he is violating a fundamental
principle in design if by planting vines to grow around a building,
he obscures the foundation, and the roof appears, consequently, to
rest on and be supported by the stems and leaves of the vines. Thus
it is seen that the eye registers a sense of structural weakness when
the main supports of an object disappear and are no longer to be
traced under the enrichment.</p>

<p>Under the second point falls the indiscriminate placing of
unrelated objects in the contour enrichment. Naturalistic objects
similar to the claw foot and the human head, for example, should give
way to natural curves that add to the appearance of total strength.
Where are we to find these curves suited to our purpose?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Valuable
Curves for
Outline
Enrichment</div>

<p>Up to this point emphasis has been placed upon straight and
curved lines immediately connected with pure service. For grace
and lightness it is necessary to depart at times from the rigidity
of straight lines. To understand the character of this departure
let us consider a simple bracket as a support for a shelf.</p>

<p>This bracket acts as a link, connecting a vertical wall or leg with
a horizontal member or shelf. A bracket shaped like a 45-degree
triangle, <a href="#Plate_8">Figure 10</a>, <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>, gives one the sense of clumsiness. If the
feeling of grace is to be imparted the eye must move smoothly
along the outline of the bracket, giving one a sensation of aesthetic
pleasure. A curved line will produce this effect more completely
than will a straight line. One must likewise get the feeling that
the curve of the bracket is designed to support the shelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="section">The Curve of Force</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Valuable
Curves</div>

<p>Turning to <a href="#Plate_20">Figure 70</a>, <a href="#Plate_20">Plate 20</a>, we find that whenever nature
desires to support a weight she is inclined to use a peculiar curve seen
at <i>F</i>. Possibly through continued observation the eye has associated
this curve with strength or supporting power. <a href="#Plate_20">Figure 71</a>
has detailed this curve. It is found to consist of a long, rather flat
portion with a quick and sudden turn at its end. The curve is
known to designers as the Curve of Force and is most valuable in
all forms of enrichment. Designers even in early ages used it in
some form as will be noted from the fragment of Greek sculpture
in <a href="#Plate_20">Figure 72</a>. Its beauty rests in its variety. A circle has little
interest due to its rather monotonous curvature. The eye desires
variety and the curve of force administers to this need and gives a
sense of satisfaction. As designers on wood, how are we to utilize
this curve for purposes of outline enrichment?</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Approximate
Curve
of Force</div>

<p>For approximate similarity of curvature an ellipse constructed
as shown in <a href="#Plate_20">Figure 73</a> will be found convenient. By drawing several
ellipses of varying sizes upon sheets of tin or zinc, a series of templates
of utmost practical value may be formed and used as was done in
securing the curves of force in <a href="#Plate_20">Figures 74</a> and <a href="#Plate_20">75</a>. If the rail or shelf
is longer than the post, measured downward from the rail to the floor
or to the next shelf, the ellipse should be used with its major axis
placed in a horizontal position, <a href="#Plate_20">Figure 75</a>. If, on the contrary, the
post is longer than the shelf the ellipse should have its major axis
in a vertical position, <a href="#Plate_20">Figure 74</a>. <a href="#Plate_20">Figures 76</a> and <a href="#Plate_20">77</a> show other
instances of the use of the approximate curve of force. Many
similar practical applications will occur to the designer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mouldings</div>

<p>We have classed the bracket as a link connecting a vertical and
horizontal structure. Mouldings may likewise be considered as
links connecting similar horizontal or vertical surfaces by bands of
graded forms. Inasmuch as they effect the outline they are considered
in this chapter. As the mouldings are to assist the eye to make
the jump from one surface to another by easy steps, the position
from which the mouldings are to be seen determines to some extent
their design.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_21" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="500" height="677" alt="Enrichment of the Contour or Outline by Mouldings Applied to Wood" />
<span class="caption smcap">Plate 21</span>
</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_21">Figure 78</a> shows the relation of the spectator to three types of
mouldings at <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. The top or <i>crown</i> (<i>A</i>) is to be seen from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
below. On a large project the angle of the mouldings with the body
of the object should be approximately 45 degrees. The <i>intermediate</i>
moulding (<i>B</i>) is lighter than the crown and forms a transitional
link that may be seen from either above or below. The lower or <i>base</i>
moulding (<i>C</i>) is the widest member of the group as demanded by
our sense of stability. It is seen from above. Both for sanitary and
structural reasons it projects but slightly from the base. With this
grouping in mind it is needless to say that a faulty moulding is one,
some portion of which, hidden by intervening moulding, cannot be
seen by the spectator.</p>

<p>Architectural design and history have formulated a series of
curves, geometric in character, that are regarded as standards in the
Industrial Arts. Some of the more prominent curves with their
constructions are shown in <a href="#Plate_21">Figure 79</a>. The horizontal divisions are
analyzed in accordance with Rules 2a and 2b. It is noticed that the
Scotia possesses a curve having the shape of the curve of force, while
the two Cymas are saved from monotonous division by means of
their reversed curves, illustrating the contrast of direction. The
curves of <a href="#Plate_21">Figure 80</a> are excellent lines for freehand practice in designing
mouldings and will develop the principle of continuity of curvature
or the smooth transition of one curve into the next.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuity
and
Contrast</div>

<p>To keep this continuity from the monotony of a Marcel Wave
it is customary to break continuous curves by a fillet such as a straight
line as shown at <i>D</i>, <a href="#Plate_21">Figures 81</a>, <a href="#Plate_21">82</a>, and <a href="#Plate_21">83</a>. When the desired outside
diameter has been reached, contrast of direction is necessary and
pleasing as a return, <a href="#Plate_21">Figure 82</a>. A glance at the curves so far
considered will quickly determine whether they are fitted for the
crown, intermediate or base mouldings. A curve should join a
straight line with either a tangential or right angle junction, which
makes for positiveness in contour expression.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grouping
of
Curves</div>

<p>Application of these curves to outline enrichment for wood
turning projects is to be governed by a strict adherence to Rules 2a
or 2b, otherwise confusion and lack of unity will result. <a href="#Plate_21">Figure 83</a>
shows a major grouping under Rule 2b with the subdivisions and
minor curves arranged under Rules 2a and 2b. <a href="#Plate_21">Figure 84</a> shows
a disregard for rules and the result is an undesirable monotony of
contour. If smooth and even continuity of curvature is given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
considerable thought, together with that for systematic grouping
and variety, a pleasing result from wood turning (a much abused
but pleasing form of outline enrichment) may be secured. Figures
<a href="#Fig_85">85</a> and <a href="#Fig_86">86</a> are illustrations from the industrial field with moulding
curves grouped, following and supporting the structural lines of the
object. The columns in <a href="#Fig_86">Figure 86</a> might, however, be advantageously
reversed.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Materials</div>

<p>Large objects designed to be seen from a distance require larger
space divisions for their mouldings than do small objects seen from
a nearer point. Material affects the curve somewhat. Smaller
mouldings are more suited to the expensive woods like mahogany
while larger curves may be used in pine or oak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution of
Enriched
Outline
Design</div>

<p>We now have at our command a number of interesting and
serviceable curves suited to the material. <a href="#Plate_22">Plate 22</a> is a sheet of
applications. <a href="#Plate_22">Figures 87</a> to <a href="#Plate_22">94</a> deal with the book-rack end and in
this, as in the <a href="#Chap_I">initial chapter</a>, architecture is referred to as the source
for many laws of industrial design. It has seemed wise to illustrate
some of these important parallels as follows:</p>

<p>We will assume the type of joint construction of the book-rack end
as settled and the question of enrichment to be under consideration.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_22">Figure 87</a> is a simple primary mass without enrichment. It is
comparable to the plain box-like structure with monotonous outline
and without interest. The eye follows the outline in the direction
of the arrows, pausing at the square corners, which interrupt a free
movement by a harsh right angle. The base (an appendage) repeats
in each instance the lines of the primary mass.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_22">Figure 88</a>. Round corners, by freeing the design from the right
angles, accelerate the eye movement and give a sense of added
interest and grace to the contour.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_22">Figure 89</a>. The cornice of a building suggests a similar arrangement
which may be added to the primary mass. It adds the element
of contrast of direction and variety of widths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variations</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_22">Figure 90</a>. The main primary mass of a building with two
equal appendages will suggest the enrichment of the outline in sympathy
with three vertical divisions. Rule 3b. The rounded corners
again assist the eye to travel freely around the contours, thus giving
a sense of unity to the entire form.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_22">Figure 91</a>. The pediment of a Greek temple with the interest
centered at the top of the pediment (<i>x</i>) causes a similar concentration
of interest in the book-rack end. The slight inclination of the sides
supplies variety of widths. The architect considers an object with
the interest centered in this manner in the upper portion, as possessing
more individuality than a motive with purely horizontal lines
across the top boundary.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_22">Figure 93</a>. The addition of an appendage to the outline of the

the book-rack end which gives increased interest and grace through
variety.</p>

<p>Before closing with enriched outlines it is well to consider
flagrant violations of this enrichment now on the market. <a href="#Fig_101">Figure
101</a> shows a typical example of complete lack of unity and simplicity.
It is a type of design often associated with cheaply constructed furniture.
It is an ornate parody on outline enrichment. The curves
of extravagance are well shown in <a href="#Fig_102">Figure 102</a> where large bulbous
curves with no systematic grouping combine disastrous waste of
material with lack of grace or lightness. It is excellent practice
to redesign such examples as those shown in <a href="#Fig_101">Figures 101</a> and <a href="#Fig_101">102</a>
with special reference to Rule 5c.</p>

<p>Rule 5c. <i>Outline enrichment, by its similarity, should give a sense
of oneness or unity to the design, binding divergent members together.</i></p>

Illustrations <a href="#Fig_103">103</a> to <a href="#Fig_106">106</a> are typical forms of present day outline
enrichment. Limitations of space will not permit reference to the use

ENRICHMENT OF THE CONTOURS OR OUTLINES OF
DESIGNS IN CLAY</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Need of
Enrichment</div>

<p>In the medium we are now about to consider there is a tendency
for the enthusiastic beginner to over-elaborate the outline into
meaningless forms. This possibly is due to the ease with which
clay is manipulated. It would be well then to ask two questions
before starting with the work of enriching the simple structure.
First, why should it be enriched&mdash;is there a positive gain by so doing?
Second, (if the decision is favorable to enrichment) where should it be
enriched? Let us co-ordinate the parts to assist in this process.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parts
Differing
in Function</div>

<p>Rule 5d. <i>Parts of one design differing in function should differ
in appearance but be co-ordinated with the entire design.</i> As a suggestion
to guide one in enriching an object it is necessary to consider
that parts differing in function may differ in appearance, but as
members of one family they should still be related to the whole. For
example, a spout, handle, and lid may differ in design from that of the
body of a pitcher because they differ from it in function. Again, the
rim and foot of a vase may be slightly changed or individually accented
because of their respective duties. The base and holder of a candlestick
may vary in design from the central part or handle, as each has
a special function to perform. This rule of the change of appearance
with the change of functional service (Rule 5d), is found throughout
architectural design. The variation in design in the base, shaft,
and capital of a column is possibly one of the most common examples.
While differing in function they still <i>must have unity and "hold
together."</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Unity</div>

<p>These functional parts of one design, differing in service rendered,
form centers of construction and may receive emphasis in outline
enrichment. Corners and terminal points are likewise available
for decoration and will be discussed at length later.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_107" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="500" height="369" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 107.&mdash;Clay Outline Enrichment in the Rookwood Potteries</p>
</div>

<p>Enrichment in clay and metal generally means a substitution
of curved for straight lines in the enriched portions of the design.
These curves have the ability to impart grace, lightness, and variety
to an object provided they are based upon constructive features
of the problem. They must have a unit of measurement and
must likewise be appropriate to the material. It is therefore
necessary to deal with clay in this chapter and follow with a consideration
of metal in <a href="#Chap_VIII">another chapter</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_24">Figures 109</a> to <a href="#Plate_24">123</a>, <a href="#Plate_24">Plate 24</a>, we have a number of examples
of variation of practically the same primary enclosing rectangle.
<a href="#Plate_24">Figure 108</a> represents a "squarely" proportioned circular bowl
lacking both refinement of proportion and enrichment. <a href="#Plate_24">Figure 109</a>
has added refinement of proportions. <a href="#Plate_24">Figures 110</a> and <a href="#Plate_24">111</a> have
introduced an outline enriched to the extent of a simple curve. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
base is the dominant width in the first, and the top dominates in
width in the second. The outline in <a href="#Plate_24">Figure 112</a>, while similar to <a href="#Plate_24">110</a>
for a portion of its length, departs at a stated point and by curving
in toward the base supplies more variety to the contour. We have
already said that this outline curve should have a unit of measurement
and by referring to Rules 2a and 2b we are able to formulate the
following:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unit of
Measurement
for Curves
in Outline
Enrichment</div>

<p>Rule 5e. <i>In cylindrical forms outline curves with a vertical tendency
should have their turning points or units of measurement in accordance
with the horizontal divisions of Rules 2a and 2b.</i> <a href="#Plate_24">Figures 112</a>
and <a href="#Plate_24">113</a> have as their unit of measurement two horizontal spaces
formed in accordance with Rule 2a, while <a href="#Plate_24">Figures 116</a> and <a href="#Plate_24">117</a> have
still more variety by the addition of a compound curve with its
turning points or unit of measurement based upon Rule 2b. <a href="#Plate_24">Figures
114</a> and <a href="#Plate_24">115</a> with outlines similar to those in <a href="#Plate_24">Figures 112</a> and <a href="#Plate_24">113</a>,
respectively, have an additional enrichment, the foot and rim
accentuation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accentuation
of Functional
Parts in Clay</div>

<p>The new element of enrichment consists of accenting by adding
to the design a modeled rim and a base or foot, as it is technically
known. This not only strengthens the structure at these two
functional points but, by adding a small section of shadow, it tends
to break up the surface, <a href="#Plate_24">Figure 127</a>, and add to the variety of enrichment.
<a href="#Plate_24">Figures 124</a> to <a href="#Plate_24">127</a> show the building processes connected
with this interesting and constructive addition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appendages</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_24">Figures 116</a> to <a href="#Plate_24">119</a> show variations of the preceding figures while
<a href="#Plate_24">Figures 120</a> to <a href="#Plate_24">123</a> introduce the appendages to preceding figures.
As in the designing of all appendages, discussed in <a href="#Chap_V">Chapter V</a>, it is
the designer's intention to balance spout and handle to avoid a
one-sided or top-heavy appearance.</p>

<p>One of the principal difficulties that confronts the amateur
designer is the failure to secure variety while retaining unity. This
is largely due to a lack of ideas upon the subject and a marked lack
of systematic development of one theme.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_24" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

<p class="caption smcap">Plate 24</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Systematic
Development
of Outline
Enrichment
in Clay</div>

<p>Attention is directed to the diagram in the lower portion of
<a href="#Plate_24">Plate 24</a>. The idea is to start with some simple form in columns
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, <a href="#Plate_24">Figure 128</a>. <a href="#Plate_24">Figure 129</a> introduces <i>two</i> horizontal
divisions. Rule 2a. The <i>black</i> portion is the dominant section.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Notice the change in outlines based upon this division. <a href="#Plate_24">Figure 130</a>
raises the division point of the two subdivisions into the upper half
of the object. This brings out the need of an accented foot which is,
however, not of sufficient prominence to be considered as a horizontal
spacing. <a href="#Plate_24">Figure 131</a> raises the horizontal division points, again
causing the introduction of a larger foot and now qualifying it as a
division of the whole mass. This then makes our design a three-division
problem, Rule 2b, and places it under the restrictions of
Rule 5e.</p>

<p>The feet of all of the bowls have been systematically decreased
in width by the converging lines <i>C-C</i> while the tops have been
maintained constant in width. By this simple diagram an infinite
number of designs may be formed and the choice of selection from the
series, thoughtfully exercised, will supply the ideal bowl, ready
to be translated into a full size working drawing. It is not the idea,
however, to guarantee a perfect design in each one of these divisions
as that would be practically impossible, but we have systematically
applied a method of determination for stimulating the imagination.
A series of articles by F.H. Rhead in the Keramic Studio first suggested
the system of development by means of graded rectangles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Candlesticks</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_25">Plate 25</a> shows a further elaboration of the succeeding themes.
The candlestick series, <a href="#Plate_25">Figures 132</a> to <a href="#Plate_25">138</a>, introduces two or three-space
division problems with contour turning points at <i>A</i>, Rule 5e,
and with accented or embryonic feet and rims. The change from
the purely functional and unenriched member of <a href="#Plate_25">Figure 132</a> through
the series shows the enrichment changing slightly to meet the needs
of the three functional parts: the base, the handle, and the candle
socket. Rule 5d.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Containers</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_25">Figure 139</a> shows a series of illustrations representing variations
for containers. The first figure is without enrichment, followed by
variations of the outline in the manner already suggested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pourers</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_25">Figure 140</a> indicates a series of pourers with the least attractive
design on the left end. This unsatisfactory design is found, upon
analysis, to be due to centrally placed horizontal division violating
Rule 2a. The design of the appendages in this series will again be
found to conform with the rules in <a href="#Chap_V">Chapter V</a>. The units of measurement
for the curves may be readily ascertained from observation.</p>

Masses</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_25">Figure 141</a> is useful for the following purpose. It is desirable
at times to develop a number of similar forms for a set, with a gradually
increasing ratio of proportions, either in height or width.
<a href="#Plate_25">Figure 141</a> shows how the <i>height</i> may be increased while maintaining
a common width. Notice the gradual proportionate increase of the
height of the neck <i>A-B</i> as well as that of the body. The line <i>X</i> is of
the utmost value in ascertaining the height of the intermediate
bowls. The eye should now be so trained that the height of the neck
<i>A-B</i> on the last bowl can be readily proportioned by <i>eye measurement</i>
to that of the first bowl. A line similar to <i>X</i> will give the intermediate
points.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_25">Figure 142</a> varies the <i>width</i> in a similar manner. Notice the
gradually decreasing distances <i>C-D-E-F</i>, the spaces for which may
be determined by the eye.</p>

ENRICHMENT OF THE CONTOURS OR OUTLINES OF
DESIGNS IN BASE AND PRECIOUS METALS</h2>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of the Base
Metals&mdash;Iron,
Copper,
Brass, Bronze</div>

<p>The contours of clay forms are generally free to follow the curves
and take the direction dictated by the knowledge and taste of the
designer. Metal outlines are more restricted in this respect. Metal
is frequently associated with service and consequently its design
is often governed by its intended use. For example, if we were to
design a metal drawer pull for a buffet, it would have to be considered
in relation to the character and shape of the buffet. Again, the
screws with which it is attached to the buffet would influence its
outline design. It is, in other words, a <i>dependent</i> outline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free and
Dependent
Outlines</div>

<p>To distinguish between an unrestricted outline and one bound
by other considerations we will term the restricted outline a <i>dependent
outline</i>, for its enrichment must be related to other forms either
within or without its surface. A <i>free outline</i> on the other hand is one
in which the designer is free to use his ideas unrestricted by any other
outside consideration, except service and design consistent with the
material.</p>

<p>In order to emphasize the nature of a dependent outline we have
Rule 5f. <i>Dependent outline enrichment should be related to essential
parts of a design and influenced by their forms and functions; it must
be consistent with the idea of the subject.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of Edges</div>

<p>We will start with the simplest form of outline enrichment of
base metals, the decoration of an edge. It is contrary to the laws of
service to leave sharp edges on articles intended for intimate household
use, except where cutting edges are required. The rounding
of sharp edges is likewise dictated by the laws of beauty. The
transition from one plane surface to another is assisted by a rounded
edge, as the eye takes kindly to the softened play of light and shade.</p>

<p>This gives us the simplest form of enrichment&mdash;the beveled, chamfered,
or rounded edge, <a href="#Plate_27">Figures 143</a> and <a href="#Plate_27">144</a>, <a href="#Plate_27">Plate 27</a>. The rim of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
thin 18-gauge plate is likewise improved and strengthened by lapping
the edge as shown in <a href="#Plate_27">Figure 145</a>, giving the rounded effect shown in
<a href="#Plate_27">Figure 144</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of Functional
Parts</div>

<p>There are six important functional parts with which we are
brought into common contact in industrial design of base metals.
There are many more, but these are the most common and consequently
are of the utmost importance to the designer as design
centers. These parts are itemized as follows: (1) Corners, (2) Appendages,
(3) Intermediate Points, (4) Terminals, (5) Links,
(6) Details. As the decorative treatment of each part varies with
the functional duty, Rule 5d, separate treatment and consideration
of each part will be necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of Corners</div>

<p>Corners, as extreme turning points of a design, are often found
convenient for the location of screw holes, rivets, etc. These important
construction elements become prominent functional parts of the
design and by custom and the laws of design, Rule 5d, they are
capable of receiving outline enrichment. But the contour of the
corner must be related to the screws or rivets, particularly if they are
near the edge, hence our outline becomes a <i>dependent outline</i> and as
such must be related to the rivets or screws by Rule 5f.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_27">Figures 146</a> to <a href="#Plate_27">149</a> show various arrangements of this type of
design. The unity of the design is not lost, and the functional parts
are enriched by contours related to the elements of service (rivets).
<a href="#Plate_27">Figure 153</a> shows another but slightly modified example of the same
laws applied to hinge construction. The enriched outline in this
case is closely associated with the holes in the hinge. The hinges
in turn must be related to the object for which they are designed.
<a href="#Plate_27">Figure 150</a> gives a common example of corner enrichment by means
of varying the edge at the corners, <i>i.e.</i>, by rounding the tray corners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of
Appendages</div>

<p>As appendages have distinct functional duties their design may
vary as the design of the arm of the human figure differs from the
head. Yet, as parts of the same body, they must fit the shape of the
object to which they are attached. The candle holder and handle as
appendages in <a href="#Plate_27">Figure 150</a> are designed in sympathetic relation by
means of tangential and similar curves sufficiently varied to give the
eye a feeling of variety in the design. The novel single flower
holders, <a href="#Plate_27">Figures 151</a> and <a href="#Plate_27">152</a>, with the glass test tube acting as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
container show other possible forms of the appendage design. The
first is informal while the second is formal, but both adhere to the
first simple rules of appendage design. Rule 4a, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of Intermediate
Points</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_156a" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="300" height="601" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 156a.&mdash;Candlestick, Rendered by E.R.</p>
</div>

<p>The enrichment of center or intermediate points should be handled
with great care and with a definite reason. Careless handling may
cause the design to lack unity. <a href="#Plate_27">Figures 154</a> and <a href="#Plate_27">155</a> show a simple
twist as enrichment. The serviceable reason for this is to obtain a
grip at the point of the twist. Again, it varies the character of the
straight edges and adds interest without loss of compactness or unity.
If one is desirous of widening a vertical or horizontal rod, the enrichment
made by welding a number of small rods together with a spreading
twist gives a pleasing and serviceable handle. <a href="#Plate_27">Figure 156</a>.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Plate 28</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of Terminals<br /><br />Free and
Dependent
Contour
Enrichment</div>

<p>As the public demands a happy ending to a story or a play, so does
the eye demand a well-designed ending to a design. The part that
terminal enrichment plays in industrial design is, therefore, to say
the least, important to us as designers. <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 157</a> illustrates
terminals in thin metal and is shown by courtesy of the <i>School Arts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Magazine</i> from one of the articles by Mr. Augustus Rose. The outlines
are in part dependent in character, controlled by rivets.
Notice the change of curve as the function changes from the <i>dependent
curve</i> of the rivet area to the <i>free outline</i> of the handle and again from
the handle to the cutting blade; a functional change of marked
character, but in thorough unity with the entire design. It is again
emphasized that whether the design possesses a free or a dependent
outline, or a combination of both types, all parts of the design must
be held together by entire <i>unity</i>. The rivets are occasionally placed
toward the edge and a domed boss is used to accent the center as is
shown in <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 158</a>.</p>


<h3 class="section">The Ionic Volute</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Terminal
Enrichment
in Wrought
Metal</div>

<p>As the Curve of Force was a valuable curve in wood construction,
so we find it an equally valuable curve for wrought metal. Its
recurrence again and again in industrial design leads us to appreciate
its value in the arts. It is the Ionic volute handed down to us in its
present form from the time of the Greeks, who developed it to a high
state of perfection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curve of Beauty</div>
<p>While its geometric development is a tedious process, it may be
easily constructed for practical purposes by the following method.
In <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 159</a>, <i>P</i> represents a small cylinder of wood, possibly a
dowel. A strong piece of thread, or fine wire, is wrapped around the
base of the dowel a number of times and a loop is formed in the free
end. A pencil with a sharp point is inserted in the loop and the
pencil and dowel are placed together on a sheet of paper. As the
thread unwinds from the dowel the point of the pencil will describe
a volute which may be developed indefinitely. It will be noticed
that no corresponding parts of the curve are concentric and it thus
has constant variety.
It has been termed the <span class="smcap">Curve of Beauty</span>
and is found in nature in the wonderfully designed shell of the
nautilus.</p>

<p>It is advisable to form several templates for the volute out of bent
wrought iron, of different sizes, and to practice drawing the curve
many times to accustom the hand and the eye to its changes of direction.
The "eye" or center portion is sometimes terminated by
thinning and expanding in the manner shown in <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 160</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Greek
Scroll</div>

<p>One form of application of the volute is shown in the terminal
points of the candlestick in <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 161</a>. It is here shown combined
with the second volute in the form of a reverse curve. In <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 162</a>,
it has been combined with a smaller but reversed volute at the upper
end. The entire and combined curve is commonly known as a
Greek Scroll. In <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 163</a> the Greek Scroll has been combined
with the reverse curve of <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 161</a> to form a portion of the bracket.
In this figure we find the familiar curve of force faithfully serving its
function as a supporting member for the top portion of the bracket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of Links</div>

<p>A link is a convenient filler in connecting parts of a right angle.
It likewise serves as a brace in connecting several disconnected parts
and is useful in maintaining the unity of a design. <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 164</a> shows
a common form of link with its ends thinned and expanded as shown
in <a href="#Plate_28">Figure 160</a>. This construction may, however, be disregarded as it
is technically quite difficult to accomplish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
of Details</div>

<p>Details are the smaller portions of a design and are similar to the
trimmings and minor brackets of a building in relative importance.
They enter to a considerable extent into wrought metal grille design,
and are generally formed of the link, Greek scroll, or the Ionic volute,
so as to be in harmony with the other parts of the design outline.
Rule 5f. Their presence and use may be readily detected on <a href="#Plate_28">Plate 28</a>.</p>

<p>Rule 5g. <i>A curve should join a straight line with either a tangential
or right angle junction.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary of
Wrought
Metal
Free Outline
Enrichment</div>

<p>As we are now familiar with continuity in wood moulding curves
we should feel, in reviewing the figures in this chapter, the value of
flowing continuity and tangential junction points (Rule 5g) necessary
in wrought metal enrichment. The curves that we have considered
are adapted to the materials and a comparatively large and new field
of design is opened to the designer through a combination of curves
mentioned. <a href="#Plate_30">Plate 30</a> is self-explanatory and brings out the general
application of the foregoing principles as applied to cast bronze
hardware. It is interesting to notice the change of enrichment
paralleling the change of function as outlined in Rule 5d.</p>


<h3 class="section">Outline Enrichment of Precious Metals</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Outline
Enrichment
of Silver<br /><br />Stones and Their Cuttings</div>

<p>Little has been written regarding the designing of jewelry. As
can be readily seen, a semi-precious stone is the controlling factor
in the major portion of the designs with silver as a background.
Any enrichment merely accentuates the beauty of the setting. This
statement would lead us to consider the outline as <i>dependent</i> in
character and thoroughly related to the stone. It is necessary then
to take the stone as a point of departure.
The standard stone cuttings
used in simple jewelry are shown in <a href="#Plate_29">Figures 166</a> to <a href="#Plate_29">170</a>. The
first three and the last are cabochon cut, elliptical in contour with
flat bottoms. The long axes have been drawn in each instance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation of
Stone to
Contour</div>

<p>With <a href="#Plate_29">Figures 171</a> to <a href="#Plate_29">174</a> we begin to see the close relation between
the stone and its enclosing form. Rule 5f. A longer major axis
in the stone calls for an increased length in the corresponding axis
of the silver foundation or background. It is really a re-echo of
the proportions of the primary mass of the stone in the mass of the
silver. It is well for the beginner to make the axis of the stone and
the silver blank coincide and to use this long axis as a basis for
future enrichment. In a vertical primary mass, similar to the one
shown in <a href="#Plate_29">Figure 180</a>, it is better design to place the stone a short
distance above the geometric center of the mass as it insures a sense
of stability and balance. A stone when placed toward the bottom
of a design of this nature is inclined to give a feeling of "settling
down" or lost balance.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_29">Figure 176</a> varies the design shown in <a href="#Plate_29">Figure 171</a>. The two
circles related to the stone are connected by four silver grains or balls.
<a href="#Plate_29">Figure 177</a> shows an attempt to enrich the contour of the silver,
but there is a resulting tendency to detract from the simplicity of
the unbroken outline and, as a result, little is gained by its attempted
enrichment. <a href="#Plate_29">Figures 178</a> and <a href="#Plate_29">179</a> show a better form of enrichment
by accentuating the outline. This may be accomplished either by
engraving a single line paralleling the contour or by soldering a thin
wire around the outline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Need of
Top and
Side Views</div>

<p>While the top view of an article of jewelry may have been carefully
designed the side view in most instances is totally neglected. The
side view should show a steady graduation from the surface of the
silver to the outline of the stone. This prevents the stone from
bulging from the surface like a sudden and unusual growth. Doming,
small wedges of silver, or a twist around the bezel may accomplish
this as can be readily seen in <a href="#Plate_29">Figures 181</a>, <a href="#Plate_29">182</a>, and <a href="#Plate_29">183</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motives
for Outline
Enrichment
in Silver</div>

<p>While emphasis should be placed upon simplicity of outline,
certain well regulated forms of enrichment may be added to the
contour and enhance the beauty of the stone. Such motives with
constructive steps are shown in <a href="#Plate_29">Figure 184</a> and their application in
<a href="#Plate_29">Figures 185</a> to <a href="#Plate_29">188</a>. It will be noticed that the enrichment <i>invariably
leads up to the stone</i> which is the center of interest in the design.
The ornament is likewise based upon the prominent axes of the stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free Outline

<p><a href="#Plate_29">Figures 189</a>, <a href="#Plate_29">190</a>, and <a href="#Plate_29">191</a> are types of beaten and raised silver
work and show characteristic forms in silver, with two examples of
accented outline enrichment. As they are curvilinear forms, their
design is similar in many ways to clay forms of similar proportions
and uses.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF DESIGN STEPS</h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Draw the unenriched primary mass.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) For dependent contours, locate the elements of service within the primary
mass. This may be interpreted to mean rivets, screw holes, semi-precious
stones, etc.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Determine upon the portion of the contours to be enriched, gauged by its
need for grace, lightness, and variety. This enrichment is preferably
concentrated at the following points: edges, corners, appendages, intermediate
points, terminals, links, and details. These points may be combined
provided the result does not violate the simplicity of the structural
lines.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Draw the enrichment in the predetermined area, causing it to be in harmony
with such interior functional parts as screw holes, rivets, semi-precious
stones, etc. Utilize suggested curves.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Review all of the contour curves added to the design. Are they feeble
compass curves or do they have the character of long sweeping curves
with short "snappy" turns for variety?</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Test the entire design for unity. Does the eye move smoothly through
all parts of the contour? Does the design "hold together"? Are all
links and appendages joined to the primary mass in a graceful tangential
manner?</p>

SURFACE ENRICHMENT OF SMALL PRIMARY
MASSES IN WOOD</h2>


<p>With this chapter we enter upon a consideration of the third and
last major division of Industrial Arts Design, that of Surface Enrichment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature and
Need of
Surface
Enrichment</div>

<p>We have considered in previous chapters the subject of contour
or outline enrichment. Now consider for a moment the fact that
articles such as a square box, or tile, are not suited to outline enrichment,
yet they have large, flat, and rather monotonous surfaces
capable of decoration. It is readily seen that such surfaces will
admit of further elaboration which we will distinguish from contour
enrichment by using the term Surface Enrichment. As in contour
enrichment, so in surface enrichment, the added element of design
not only increases the beauty of the object but it likewise, if properly
applied, gives apparent added strength to the structure.</p>

<p>Rule 6a. <i>Surfaces to be enriched must admit of enrichment.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">When and
Where to
Enrich a
Surface</div>

<p>Strictly utilitarian articles should not be ornamented by surface
enrichment. As an example, a wooden mixing spoon, bowl, or wooden
knife handle should not be enriched by carving, as the carving would
interfere with the proper cleansing of the article. A surface exposed
to considerable wear should not be enriched. Objects not strictly
in the utilitarian class, such as a paper knife, book stall, envelope
holder, or library table may be appropriately enriched in an unostentatious
manner so that they will harmonize with their surroundings.
But the enrichment should first be placed upon the surface in such a
manner that it will not interfere with the functional use of the article
for service. Large projections upon the back of a chair or upon the
handle of a paper cutter are unpleasant and interfere with intended
uses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_191a" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="500" height="726" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 191a.&mdash;Structure Obscured by Surface and Contour Enrichment</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Rule 6b. <i>Surface enrichment must be related to the structural
contours but must not obscure the actual structure.</i></p>

<p>Careful consideration should be given to the often-mentioned law
that the surface enrichment must be thoroughly related to structure
and contour but not so as to obscure either. We must keep in mind
the fact that it is necessary to support the structure, not to cover
it up by related ornament, as in <a href="#Fig_191a">Figure 191a</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conservative
Use of
Ornament</div>

<p>Most critics of industrial design complain of an overwhelming
desire upon the part of the designer to over-decorate the structure.
Surface enrichment runs wild over steam radiators, stoves, and
wooden rocking chairs. Reserve is the watchword recommended as
of extreme importance. The illustrations in this chapter are restricted
to a limited range of design motives for the express purpose
of simplifying the number of recommended methods.</p>

<p>Rule 6c. <i>The treatment must be appropriate to the material.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation of
Enrichment
to Material</div>

<p>The close-fibered woods with smooth, even textures are capable
of more delicate enrichment than woods of coarser grain. Small
articles are generally seen from a close range and should, therefore,
be ornamented with finer decoration than large articles, such as
a piece of furniture that is to be seen from a distance. The latter
should have surface enrichment of sufficient boldness to "carry"
or to be distinct from a distant point. Furthermore the enrichment
should not have a "stuck on" appearance, but be an integral part of
the original mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appropriate
Methods of
Surface
Enrichment
for Wood</div>

<p>There are three distinct means of ornamenting wood: (1) inlaying,
depending for interest upon the difference in value and hue of the
different inlaying woods used; (2) carved enrichment, depending
upon line and mass for its beauty and made visible by contrasts of
light and shade; (3) painting or staining of the surface with the interest
dependent upon the colors or stains and their relation to each other
and to the hue of the wood. It has been deemed wise to consider the
first two types in the present chapter, and leave the last type for
later consideration. In Chapters <a href="#Chap_XV">XV</a>, <a href="#Chap_XVI">XVI</a>, and <a href="#Chap_XVII">XVII</a>, accentuation
has been placed on wood coloring. The designer is advised to read
those chapters before attempting to stain or color his problem.</p>

<img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="500" height="665" alt="Straight Line Surface Enrichment of a Small Primary Mass in Wood" />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 32</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Inlaying</div>

<p>Treating surface enrichment in its listed order we find that inlaying
is one of the most common and best forms of enrichment for wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
work. As inlaying readily adapts itself to bands and borders,
emphasis is placed upon them.</p>

<p>Rule 6i. <i>Inlayed enrichment should never form strong or glaring
contrasts with the parent surface.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Errors in
Wood Inlay</div>

<p>Two conspicuous errors are often associated with inlaid designs.
The first is the use of woods affording a glaring contrast with that of
the project. <a href="#Plate_34">Figure 209</a>, <a href="#Page_106">Page 106</a>. The right contrast of value is
established when the inlay seems neither to rise from the surface nor
sink through it. It should remain <i>on the surface</i> of the plane to be
enriched, for it is surface enrichment. <a href="#Plate_34">Figures 210</a>, <a href="#Plate_29">211</a>, and <a href="#Plate_29">212</a> are
illustrative of pleasing contrasts.</p>

<p>The second specific glaring error is the use of unrelated inlay.
As an example, an Indian club is created by gluing many varicolored
woods around a central core. The result of the pattern so formed has
little relation to the structural lines, fails entirely to support them;
and, as a result, should be discarded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carving</div>

<p>Carving is difficult for the average beginner in wood working
design, therefore merely the simplest forms of the craft are suggested
as advisable. <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 205a</a>. If an elaborate design is desired (<a href="#Plate_33">Figure
205c</a>), it should be first drawn in outline and finally modeled in relief
by Plastelene. This model is then an effective guide for the carver,
supplementing the original outline drawing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions of
Carving</div>

<p>Carving may be roughly divided into the following groups:
(1) high relief carving similar to heads, human figures, and capitals;
(2) low relief carving in which the planes have been flattened to a
comparatively short distance above the original block of wood,
such as panels, which are good examples of this group; (3) pierced
carving where the background has been entirely cut away in places,
such as screens, which illustrate this type; (4) incised carving in which
the design has been depressed <i>below</i> the surface of the wood. Geometric
chip carving is a representative type of this group. There are
possible variations and combinations of these groups.</p>

<p>Rule 6j. <i>Carved surface enrichment should have the appearance of
belonging to the parent mass.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_33" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="500" height="671" alt="Surface Enrichment of Small Primary Masses in Wood With Borders of Curved and Straight Lines" />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 33</p>
</div>

<p><i>The central governing thought</i> in all carved designs is to show an
interesting proportion of light and shade coupled with a unity between
the raised portion of the design and the background. If the carving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
has a glued on appearance it becomes mechanical and resembles a
stamped or machine-produced ornament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steps Taken
in Carving</div>

<p>A typical carved enrichment is carried through four steps:
(1) the design is transferred to the wood surface by means of carbon
paper; (2) the design is "set in" or separated from the ground by
means of a grooved chisel; (3) the wood is cut away from the back
of the design by a process of grounding; (4) the leaves and flowers
or other elements of the design are modeled. The designer should
keep these processes in mind when developing his design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Designer's
Vocabulary</div>

<p>It is now essential to find the extent of the vocabulary possible
for the designer of surface enrichment. He has three large sources
of information: first, geometric forms and abstract spots; second,
natural organic objects such as flowers, leaves, animals, etc.; third,
artificial objects, pots, jars, ink bottles, and other similar objects.</p>

<p>He may assemble or group these objects or elements for future
designs into four typical systems: first, bands or borders; second,
panels; third, free ornament; and fourth, the diaper or all-over
patterns.</p>


<h3 class="section">Designing Bands on Borders</h3>

<p>Rule 6d. <i>Bands and borders should have a consistent lateral, that is,
onward movement.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6e. <i>Bands and borders should never have a prominent contrary
motion, opposed to the main forward movement.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bands</div>

<p>Bands are particularly suitable for inlaying. They are composed
of straight lines arranged in some orderly and structurally related
manner. They are used for bordering, framing, enclosing, or connecting.
They give a decided <i>onward</i> motion which tends to increase
the apparent length of the surface to which they are applied. Referring
to <a href="#Plate_32">Plate 32</a>, <a href="#Plate_32">Figure 192</a>, we find three typical bands, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>.
It is often the custom to limit the width of the inlayed bands to the
width of the circular saw cut. To secure unity, the center band in
<i>C</i> is wider than the outside sections.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_34" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_108.jpg" width="500" height="668" alt="Surface Enrichment of Small Primary Masses in Wood" />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 34</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Accenting</div>

<p>A possible variation of motive in band designing may be secured
by accenting. The single band has been broken up at <i>D</i> into geometric
sections of pleasing length. But while this design gives
variety, it also destroys the unity of a single straight line. Unity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
may, however, be restored by the addition of the top and bottom
bands at <i>E</i>. This method of restoring unity is of extreme value in
all border arrangements and is constantly used by the designer.</p>

<p>Rule 6f. <i>All component parts of a border should move in unison
with the main movement of the border.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Borders</div>

<p>Bands, as has just been stated, give distinctly "onward" movement.
Borders are merely bands combined with other motives from
the designer's vocabulary. As will be seen, bands, by their onward
movement, tend to hold the other elements of the border together.
<a href="#Plate_32">Figure 193</a> is a border design without variety, unity, or interest.
<a href="#Plate_32">Figure 194</a> has added unity to a similar border by the addition of the
double bands, but monotony is still present. <a href="#Plate_32">Figure 195</a> suggests a
method of relieving the monotony by accentuating every other repeat,
thus supplying variety and creating an analogy to march-time music.
<a href="#Plate_32">Figure 196</a> has accentuated the monotonous border in <a href="#Plate_32">Figure 194</a>
by omitting every other square. This makes a simple and effective
inlay pattern and suggests a large number of possible variations that
could be applied to accented band motives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moorish
Ornament</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_32">Figures 197</a> and <a href="#Plate_32">198</a> are border motives of geometric derivation
taken from the historic schools of ornament. <a href="#Plate_32">Figure 198</a> illustrates
the "strap ornament" of the Moorish school. The simple underlying
geometric net upon which these designs are based may be found in
Meyer's Handbook of Ornament.</p>


<h3 class="section">Inceptive Axes</h3>

<p>Rule 6h. <i>Borders intended for vertical surfaces may have a strongly
upward movement in addition to the lateral movement, provided the
lateral movement dominates.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Upward and
Onward
Borders</div>

<p>In addition to the purely onward borders we now come to a
variety with a distinctly <i>upward</i> movement as well. While this new
feature adds materially to the interest of the border, it also adds to
the difficulty of designing. The upward movement is often centered
about an axis termed the Axis of Symmetry or Inceptive Axis, about
which are grouped and balanced the different elements from the
designer's vocabulary. When both sides are alike, the unit so formed
is called a <i>bilateral unit</i>. <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 199</a> shows the formation of a bilateral
unit by means of grouping, accenting, and balancing straight lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
over an inceptive axis. By adding bands above and below and doubling
these vertical lines to gain width, we form at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 199</a>,
inlaid designs with an upward and onward tendency or movement.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 215.&mdash;Inlaid Band Border</p>
</div>

<p>The introduction of curved lines and natural units allows us to add
more grace to these combined movements. The leading lines of a
small border, designed to be seen at close range, are planned in
<a href="#Plate_33">Figure 200</a>. The central line or inceptive axis is repeated at regular
intervals and the leading or skeleton lines are balanced to the right
and left of this axis. These leading lines, as can be readily seen, have
an upward and onward movement. To insure continuity, a small
link and the top and bottom bands have been added to complete
the onward movement.</p>

Material for straight borders may be derived from geometry,
nature, or artificial forms, but for borders designed in curves, nature
is generally selected as a source.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_33">Figure 201</a> illustrates a crude and uninteresting form, unsuited
to outline enrichment. <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 202</a> has brought <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 201</a> into some
semblance of order, but as can be readily seen by the primary outline
which encloses it, the widest point occurs exactly midway from
top to bottom, which makes the form monotonous. This defect has
been remedied in <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 203</a> and an interesting and varied area
appears for the first time. What Dr. Haney calls "the feebly flapping
curve" of <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 202</a> has been replaced by the vigorous and "snappy"

<p>Rule 6g. <i>Each component part of a border should be strongly
dynamic and, if possible, partake of the main movements of the border.</i></p>

<p>Any form which causes the eye to move in a given direction is
strongly <i>dynamic</i>, and is opposed to the <i>static</i> form which does not
cause a marked eye movement. A circle is symbolic of the static
form, while a triangle is dynamic. In the designer's nomenclature,
the term "rhythmic" may be used synonymously with "dynamic."</p>

<p>Dynamic areas or forms should carry out the upward and onward
movement of the leading lines. <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 204</a> shows how closely
dynamic areas are connected with nature's units for design motives.
A slight change in the contour may transform a leaf into excellent
material with which to clothe the leading lines. The curve of force,
the cyma, and other curves described in previous chapters should
be recognized by the designer and utilized in the contours of dynamic
forms.</p>

<p>The leading lines of the border in <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 200</a> are shown clothed
or enriched in <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 205</a>. Vigorous dynamic spots, conventionalized
from natural units, continue the upward and onward movement of
the original leading lines. As will be noted, the background has been
treated to allow the spots to appear in relief. Small "fussy" spots or
areas have been omitted and the units, varied in size and strongly
dynamic in form, balance over an inceptive axis. The small link
reaches out its helping hand to complete the onward movement
without loss of unity, while the bands above and below bind the
design together and assist in the lateral movement. <a href="#Plate_33">Figure 205</a>
shows three methods of treatment: simple spots without modeling,
from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>; slight indications of modeling, from <i>B</i> to <i>C</i>; full modeling
of the entire unit at <i>C</i>. The choice of treatment depends, of
course, upon the skill of the craftsman.</p>

onward movement with the leaves balanced above and below the
stem which is the axis. The "repeat" has been reversed at <i>B</i> and is
more pleasing than the portion at <i>A</i>. The area of the background,
in its relation to that used for ornamentation or "filling," cannot be
predetermined with exactness. There should be no blank spaces
for the eye to bridge. Some designers allow about one-third ground
for two-thirds filling or enrichment. This proportion gives a full
and rich effect and may be adopted in most instances as satisfactory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Point of
Concentration&mdash;Effect
upon
Structure</div>

<p>When a border is used to parallel a rectangle it is customary to
strengthen the border at the corners for two reasons: first, to
strengthen, apparently, the structure at these points; second, to
assist the eye in making the sudden turn at the corner. The corner
enforcement affords momentary resting points for the eye, and adds
pleasing variety to the long line of border. The strengthened
point is called the <i>point of concentration</i> or point of force. Its presence
and effect may be noted by the symbol P.C. in <a href="#Plate_34">Figures 207</a>, <a href="#Plate_34">208</a>,
<a href="#Plate_34">213</a>, and <a href="#Plate_34">214</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chip
Carving</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_34">Figure 213</a> represents the rather angular and monotonous chip
carving motive. It is, however, a simple form of carved enrichment
for wood construction. <a href="#Plate_34">Figure 214</a> shows the more rhythmic flow
of a carved and modeled enrichment. Two methods of leaf treatment
are given at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

SURFACE ENRICHMENT OF SMALL PRIMARY MASSES
IN WOOD&mdash;Continued</h2>

<h3 class="section">Enclosed and Free Ornament</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Enclosed
Ornament
(Panels)</div>

<p><a href="#Chap_IX">Chapter IX</a> dealt with methods of developing continuous or
repeating ornament (bands or borders). This leaves enclosed and
free forms of surface enrichment to be considered in this chapter.</p>

<p>As an enclosed form, a panel may be enriched by geometric,
natural, or artificial ornament. It is enclosed in a definite boundary
of bands or lines and may be a square or other polygon, circle, ellipse,
lunette, spandrel, lozenge, or triangle. As the decoration does not
have the continuous repeating movement of the border and as it
covers an enclosed area, it is necessarily treated in a different manner
from either band or border. Its object is to decorate a plane surface.
The enrichment may be made by means of carving, inlaying, or
painting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free
Ornament</div>

<p>Free ornament means the use of motives not severely enclosed by
bands or panels. Free ornament is generally applied to centers or
upper portions of surfaces to relieve a monotonous area not suited to
either panel or border treatment. It may have an upward or a
radial movement dependent upon the character of the member to
be enriched.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary</div>

<p>We then have three forms of possible surface enrichment: repeating
or continuous motives, enclosed motives, and free motives. Our
next point is to consider where the last two may be used appropriately
in surface enrichment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zone of
Enrichment</div>

<p>The panel of a small primary mass of wood may be enriched at any
one of three places: first, at the margins; second, at the center;
third, over the entire surface. The exact position is a matter to be
determined by the structural design and the utilitarian requirements
of the problem. For example, a bread board or taboret top would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
require the enrichment in the margin with the center left free. A
table leg might require an enrichment in the center of the upper
portion of the leg, while a square panel to be inserted in a door,
<a href="#Plate_38">Figure 233</a>, <a href="#Page_124">Page 124</a>, might require full surface treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Structural
Reinforcement</div>

<p>Each area of panel enrichment should have one or more accented
points known as points of concentration. The design should become
more prominent at these places and cause the eye to rest for a moment
before passing to the next point of prominence. The accented portion
of the design at these points should be so related to the structure
that it apparently reinforces the structure as a whole. Corners,
centers of edges, and geometric centers are salient parts of a structure;
we shall therefore be likely to find our points of concentration coinciding
with them. Let us then consider the first of these arrangements
as applied to enclosed enrichment.</p>


<h3 class="section">Marginal Panel Enrichment</h3>

<h3 class="section">Enclosed Enrichment for Partly Enriched Surfaces</h3>

<p>Rule 7a. <i>Marginal panel enrichment should parallel or be related
to the outlines of the primary mass and to the panel it is to enrich.</i></p>

<p>Rule 7b. <i>Marginal points of concentration in panels should be
placed (1) preferably at the corner or (2) in the center of each margin.</i></p>

<p>Rule 7c. <i>To insure unity of design in panels, the elements composing
the points of concentration and the links connecting them must be
related to the panel contour and to each other.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Marginal
Zone
Enrichment</div>

<p>The marginal method of enrichment may be used when it is
impossible to enrich the entire surface because the center is to be
used for utilitarian purposes or because it would be aesthetically
unwise to enrich the entire surface. The marginal zone is adapted
to enriching box tops, stands, table tops, and similar surfaces designed
preferably with the thought of being seen from above. We shall
call such surfaces horizontal planes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Points of
Concentration<br /><br /><br />Points of
Concentration
in the Corner
of Margin</div>

<p>As the design is to be limited to the margin, the panel outline is
bound to parallel the contours, or outlines, of the surface to be
enriched. It is well to begin the design by creating a panel parallel
to the outlines of the enriched surface. <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 218</a>. The next step
is to place the point of concentration in the marginal zone and within
this figure. Common usage dictates the <i>corners</i> as the proper points.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
It may be the designer's practice to use the single or double bands,
<a href="#Plate_36">Figures 218</a>, <a href="#Plate_36">219</a>, <a href="#Plate_36">220</a>, with a single accentuation at the corners.
The spots composing the point of concentration must have unity
with the enclosing contours and with the remainder of the enrichment.
<a href="#Plate_36">Figure 220</a> is, in this respect, an improvement over <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 219</a>. But
these examples are not <i>true</i> enclosed panel enrichment. They are
the borders of <a href="#Chap_IX">Chapter IX</a> acting as marginal enrichment. It is
not until we reach <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 221</a> that the true enclosed enrichment
appears, when the panel motive is clearly evident.
In this figure a
single incised band parallels the contours of the figure until the corner
is reached. Here we find it turning, gracefully widening to give
variety, and supporting the structure by its own increased strength.
The single band in <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 221</a> acts as a bridge, leads the eye from one
point of concentration to the next similar point, forms a compact
mass with the point of concentration, and parallels the enclosing
contours of the enriched surface.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Points of
Concentration
in the Center
of Margin</div>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 222</a> the point of concentration is to be found in the
<i>center</i> of each margin. This bilateral unit is clearly designed on and
about the center lines of the square panel. These points of concentration
take the place of previous concentrations at the <i>corners</i>
which were based upon the square's diagonals. While accenting
based upon the center lines is acceptable, this means of concentration
does not seem so successfully to relate the accented part to the
structural outlines as that of concentration based upon the diagonals.
The latter, therefore, is recommended for beginners. The corners
of <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 222</a> are, however, slightly accented by means of the bridging
spots <i>x-x</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inceptive
Axes or
Balancing
Lines</div>

<p>The diagonals and center lines of the surface enriched squares
of <a href="#Plate_36">Figures 221</a> and <a href="#Plate_36">222</a> and similar structural lines are <i>inceptive axes</i>,
as they are center lines for new design groups. It may then be said
that a strong basic axis or similar line depending upon the structure,
may become the center line or inceptive axis upon which to construct
a bilateral design. It is only necessary to have this inceptive axis
pass through the enrichment zone of the panel. Hereafter in the
drawings, inceptive axes will be designated by the abbreviation
I.A. while the point of concentration will be indicated by the abbreviation
P.C.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Inceptive
Axis</div>

<p>The strongest plea for the inceptive axis is the fact that it interlocks
surface enrichment with the structure, insuring a degree of
unity that might otherwise be unattainable.</p>

<p>The carved enrichment of <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 223</a> fully illustrates this point.
The analytical study of <a href="#Plate_36">Figure 224</a> shows the diagonal used as an
inceptive axis, with the leading lines grouped about it at the corner
point of concentration.</p>


<h3 class="section">Free Enrichment</h3>

<p>Rule 8a. <i>Free ornament for partly or fully enriched surfaces should
be based and centered upon an inceptive axis of the structure.</i></p>

<p>Rule 8b. <i>Free ornament should be related and subordinated to the
structural surfaces.</i></p>

<p>Rule 8c. <i>Points of concentration in free enrichment of vertically
placed masses are usually located in and around the inceptive axis and
above or below the geometric center of the design.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Center
Zone
Enrichment</div>

<p>This method of surface enrichment is used to relieve the
design of heavy members in the structure or to distribute ornament
over the surface of lighter parts in a piece of furniture. An
example is noted in <a href="#Fig_246">Figure 246</a>, <a href="#Page_128">Page 128</a>, where the upper portion of
the legs has center enrichment. As can be readily seen, the enrichment
is generally free in character with little or no indication of
enclosure. <a href="#Plate_37">Figure 225</a> shows the application of free enrichment to a
paneled screen or hinged door. The P.C. is in the upper portion of
the door and is re-echoed in the door frames, while the ornament itself
is strongly dynamic in movement with a decided upward tendency in
sympathy with the proportions of the door. This motive might be
developed by inlay, carving, or paint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Examples
of Free
Enrichment</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_37">Figure 226</a> is a carved Gothic leaf, appropriately used as enrichment
of heavy furniture. The unit may be raised above the surface
or, even more easily, depressed or incised into the surface. The small
corner spot is added with the intention of bringing the leaf into
sympathetic conformity with the contours. Note how the center
line of both units in <a href="#Plate_37">Figures 225</a> and <a href="#Plate_37">226</a> coincides with the inceptive
axis of the structure. Let it again be reiterated that this binding
of the surface enrichment to the structure by means of the coincidence
of the axes of symmetry and the inceptive axes causes the most
positive kind of unity. No part of this form of enrichment should
be carved sufficiently high to give it the appearance of being separated
from the main surface.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Plate 37</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pierced
Free
Enrichment</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_37">Figures 227</a> and <a href="#Plate_37">228</a> are additional examples of free enrichment.
<a href="#Plate_37">Figure 228</a> has introduced by its monogram the individual touch
of ownership so essential to the success of school designing. The
monogram represents free enrichment while the border is marginal
decoration with the point of concentration in the center of the top
edge. Both types of enrichment are related to each other and to the
structural contours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Errors in
the Use of
Pierced
Enrichment</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_37">Figure 229</a> is typical free <i>pierced</i> enrichment. The wood in the
enriched portion is removed and the resulting figure supplies added
lightness of construction and variety to the surface. One encounters
this form of enrichment in the average school project with greater
frequency than either inlaying or carving. It is with the thought of
adding to the possibilities of school project decoration that the latter
forms have been introduced. A word regarding the errors often
encountered in pierced enrichment of the character of <a href="#Plate_37">Figure 229</a> may
not be amiss. Pupils, believing the square to be the last word in this
form of enrichment, place the figure on the member to be enriched
with little thought of its possible relation to the structural contours;
the result is the un-unified design illustrated in <a href="#Plate_37">Figure 230</a>. To
correct this, reference should be made to Rule 8b.</p>


<h3 class="section">Full Panel Enrichment</h3>

<p>Rule 7d. <i>The contours of fully enriched panels should parallel the
outlines of the primary mass and repeat its proportions.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Full Surface
Enrichment</div>

<p>This is the richest and most elaborate form of enrichment when
carried to its full perfection. It generally takes the form of a panel
filled with appropriate design material. This panel may be used to
enrich the plain end of a project such as a book stall and thus cover
the entire surface, or it may be inserted into a large primary mass
and accentuate its center as in a door, in a manner similar to <a href="#Plate_38">Figure
233</a>. Its use, whatever its position, leads us to the consideration
of methods of designing full panels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_38" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="500" height="649" alt="Surface Enrichment of Small Primary Masses in Wood" />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 38</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Rule 7e. <i>The points of concentration for a fully enriched square
panel may be in its center or in its outer margin.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Square
Panels</div>

<p>In planning designs for full panels, it would be well to consider:
first, square panels; second, rectangular panels; third, varied panels.
The point of concentration may be kept in the <i>corners</i> of a square
panel, as designed in <a href="#Plate_38">Figure 231</a>, or it may be placed in the <i>center</i>,
as shown in <a href="#Plate_38">Figure 232</a>. The effects, when assembled, are indicated
in <a href="#Plate_38">Figure 233</a>.</p>

<p>To secure these effects, a square panel is commonly divided into
quarter sections by center lines. The diagonals of each quarter should
be drawn before proceeding with the details of the design. These
diagonals and center lines are the building lines or leading <i>axes</i> of
the pattern. The <i>leading lines and details</i> are then grouped around
these center and diagonal axes in a manner quite similar to the method
used in <a href="#Plate_38">Figures 223</a> and <a href="#Plate_38">224</a>. These leading lines are then <i>clothed with
enrichment</i> by applying the processes indicated in <a href="#Chap_IX">Chapter IX</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steps in
Panel
Designing</div>

<p>Without going into detail we may say that it is good practice:
first, to draw the square panel; second, to draw the center lines and
diagonals; third, to locate points of concentration; fourth, to make
the leading lines move inwardly to center concentration or outwardly
to corner concentration; fifth, to clothe these lines with ornament
having strongly dynamic movement corresponding to the leading
lines; sixth, to fill in remaining space with ornament, supporting
the movement toward points of concentration, even though slight
and minor contrasts of direction are added to give variety. When
the entire design is completed one should ask the following questions:
Does the design have unity? Does it seem too thin and spindling?
And most of all, do the points of concentration and shape of the
panel fit the structural outlines and proportions? We cannot fit
a square peg into a round hole; neither can we fit a square panel
into a circular or rectangular mass without considerable change
to the panel.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_38">Figures 234</a> and <a href="#Plate_38">235</a> have been drawn with the idea of suggesting
a simple and modified form of panel enrichment which may be readily
handled by the beginner. The tree as a decorative symbol is appropriate
to wood, and its adaption to a square panel is drawn at
<a href="#Plate_38">Figure 235</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rectangular
Panels</div>

<p>While a rectangular panel may be divided into sections by a
number of different methods, it is well for the beginner in design to
treat it as a vertical mass, designed to enrich a vertical surface.
This vertical panel may then be divided into halves by the axis of
symmetry, which should coincide with an inceptive axis, but it is not
essential to balance the enrichment exactly in each half. Small
deviations from exact symmetry sometimes give added variety to the
design. <a href="#Plate_38">Figure 235</a>.</p>

<p>Rule 7f. <i>The points of concentration for a fully enriched vertical
panel should be in the upper portion of the panel.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vertical
Panels</div>

<p>The point of concentration in vertical panels should be in the
upper portion, and all parts of the design, both leading lines and
clothing, should have a strong upward tendency. <a href="#Plate_38">Figure 236</a> is a
vertical panel from historic ornament. The heavier parts have been
designed at the bottom for stability and the lighter and more intricate
members have been placed at the top.</p>

<p>Rule 7g. <i>The fully enriched panel and its contents should be
designed in unified relation to the structural outlines, with the center line
of the panel coinciding with the inceptive axis of the structure.</i></p>

<p>To see how to apply rectangular panels to wood surfaces, let us
look at <a href="#Plate_38">Figure 240</a>. This is a simple design with an incised background
and might be used for enriching a narrow paneled door,
newel post, or frame. The large areas are at the bottom; the point
of concentration is at the top, and the entire design balances over
the inceptive axis. The point of concentration consists of the geometrically
treated small flower form, with its original lines modified
to simplify the carving processes. The stem coincides with the
inceptive axis, while narrow and sympathetically related minor

<h3 class="section">Varied Panels</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Panels of
Varied
Shapes</div>

<p>The panels under consideration up to this time have been designed
to harmonize with square and rectangular contours. The panel
may, however, become a most flexible and sympathetic element,
changing its form to suit the ever-changing contours. But though
change of shape affects the contents of the panel to a certain extent
the points of concentration and the inceptive axes still act as our
guide. Objects are arranged formally on each side of the inceptive
axes and the space filling is approximately the same as in former
examples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of
Artificial
Objects</div>

<p>The still life sketches of the art class may be conventionalized
into appropriate motives for utilitarian objects as shown in <a href="#Plate_39">Figure
241</a>. This use of still life suggests a most desirable correlation and a
welcome one to many drawing teachers. Three points should be
kept in mind: first, adaptability of the object, its decorative possibilities,
and appropriateness to service; second, adjustment of the
panel to contours; third, adjustment of the object to the wood panel.</p>

<p>Some portion of the object should be designed to parallel the panel.
Small additional spots may assist in promoting harmony between
the object and the panel boundary. These three considerations are
essentially necessary factors in the design of enclosed enrichment.
<a href="#Plate_39">Figures 242</a> and <a href="#Plate_39">243</a> are other adaptations of panel design to varied
contours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free
Balance</div>

<p>In the foregoing examples the designs are more or less rigidly
balanced over the inceptive axis or axis of symmetry. Imaginary
axis it is, but, acting with the panel, it nevertheless arbitrarily limits
the position of all parts within the panel. By removing this semblance
of formal balance, we approach what is termed <i>free balance</i>.
In this we find that the designer attempts to balance objects
informally over the geometric center of the panel or combined panels.
As the arrow points in <a href="#Plate_39">Figure 244</a> indicate, the problem is to balance
the trees in an informal and irregular manner, avoiding "picket
fence" regularity. In all of this freedom there is a sense of order,
since a mass of trees on one side of the geometric center is balanced
by a similar mass on the other side. Indeed, in <a href="#Plate_39">Figure 244</a> this may
be carried even to the point of duplicating in reverse order the outside
panels of the Triptych.</p>

SURFACE ENRICHMENT WITH MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
OF LARGE PRIMARY MASSES IN WOOD</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Minor
Subdivisions</div>

<p>This article is, in part, a brief summary and review of Rules
2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c (vertical and horizontal major divisions) with
application to minor subdivisions. By minor spacings or subdivisions
in wood work we refer to the areas occupied by drawers,
doors, shelves, and other small parts subordinated in size to the large
or major divisions such as large front or side panels, etc. These
smaller or minor subdivisions in wood work are bounded by runners,
rails, guides, and stiles depending upon the form of construction and
character of the minor subdivision. Major divisions are often
bounded by legs, table tops, and principal rails.</p>

<p>It is an interesting and useful fact that rules governing major
divisions generally apply equally well to minor ones. There are a
few exceptions and additions to be noted in their appropriate places.</p>

<p>When minor subdivisions are well planned they supply one of
the most interesting forms of surface enrichment or treatment, for
if we consider paneling an appropriate form of decoration, we are
equally privileged to feel that each small drawer or door adds its
quota of interest to the sum total of the entire mass. We are equally
justified in accenting these drawers or doors with panel decoration
or other forms of surface enrichment provided that harmony is
maintained.</p>

<p>These minor subdivisions, properly enriched, may become equalizers,
or elements which adjust the design to the character of the
surroundings destined to receive the project of which they are a part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vertical
Sections and
Their
Divisions</div>

<p>With reference to the illustrations, <a href="#Plate_41">Figure 247</a>, <a href="#Plate_41">Plate 41</a>, shows a
simple minor panel treatment falling under Rule 3a. Single or
preferably double band inlay might have been suitably substituted
for the sunken panels. As many craftsmen are not properly equipped
to produce inlays, it is practicable to use stock inlays, thus simplifying
the process.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minor Subdivisions
of Three Vertical
Major
Parts or
Divisions</div>

<p>In a three-part design it is the designer's desire to gain the effect
of lightness and height by the use of Rule 3b. As a simple treatment
of a three-part design, <a href="#Plate_41">Figure 248</a> needs little comment. Figures
<a href="#Plate_41">249</a> and <a href="#Plate_41">250</a> are examples of dividing, by means of minor divisions,
the outer sections of a three-part design.</p>

<p>The small drawers in the right and left sections of <a href="#Plate_41">Figure 250</a>
might have been improved in proportion by again applying Rule 2a
to their design, thereby varying the measure of their heights. The
enclosed panel enrichment affords pleasing variety to the otherwise
unvaried front panels. Rule 7g.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unbroken
Vertical
Divisions</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_41">Figures 251</a> and <a href="#Plate_41">252</a> show unbroken drawer runners continuing
through all three vertical sections, thus definitely binding these
sections together. It is seen that this device is conducive to unity,
whenever two or three vertical divisions have been used.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_41">Figure 252</a> is a repetition of <a href="#Plate_41">Figure 251</a>, but shows the echo or
continuation of the three divisions of the primary mass into the
appendage. The use of the single or double band enrichment still
further binds the minor subdivisions of the primary mass into ideal
unity with the appendage.</p>


<h3 class="section">Sequential Progression of Minor Horizontal Space Divisions</h3>

<p>Rule 2c. <i>A primary mass may be divided into three or more smaller
horizontal masses or sections by placing the larger mass or masses at the
bottom and by sequentially reducing the height measure of each mass
toward the smaller division or divisions to be located at the top of the mass.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sequential
Arrangement
of Minor
Horizontal
Divisions</div>

<p>Rule 2c. Let us now imagine the center section of a three-part
design to be removed and extended upward. Its transformation
by this process into a cabinet or chiffonier similar to <a href="#Plate_42">Figure 253</a>,
<a href="#Plate_42">Plate 42</a>, introduces the new principle of <i>sequential progression</i>.
Instead of adhering to the limitation of Rules 2a and 2b, this arrangement
shows that the horizontal divisions may be gradually decreased
in height from the bottom toward the top of the primary mass. By
this rhythmic decrease in the measure of the height, the eye is led
through an orderly gradation through lesser areas to the top, thus
giving a pleasing sensation of lightness and variety to the structure.
By this method, also, the large areas are retained at the bottom to
give stability and solidity to the structure. A quick test of these
conditions may be made by reversing <a href="#Plate_42">Figure 254</a>, thus producing a
more decidedly pleasing effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_42" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="500" height="677" alt="Surface Enrichment and Minor Space Divisions for Large Primary Masses in Wood" />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 42</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>This orderly gradation or sequence of heights need not be carried
out with absolute mathematical precision such as 7-6-5-4-3-2-1.
Arrangements similar to the following progression make for equally
pleasing and more varied effect: 9&frac14;-8-6&frac34;-6-5-4&frac34;. Many designers
repeat similar heights for two neighboring horizontal spaces as,
6-5-5-4&frac34;, but the upward gradation should be apparent. <a href="#Plate_42">Figure
255</a>, an Austrian motive, shows a strongly marked sequence with the
top division broken by Rule 3b. It is better practice to keep such
attempts confined to the bottom or top members of the sequence
or loss of unity may be the final result.</p>

<p>By applying this principle to the center section of a three-part
design, we now have illustrated in <a href="#Plate_42">Figure 256</a> the new sequence in
its application, and <a href="#Plate_42">Figures 257</a> and <a href="#Plate_42">258</a> are variations of the
same idea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two
Horizontal
and Three
Vertical
Divisions</div>

<p>We now come to the transitional type of design where three
<i>vertical</i> sections begin to lose their dominance as major divisions, but
still retain their places in the design as minor sections. Replacing
these in prominence is the <i>horizontal</i> major section or division. The
first immediate result of this change as shown in <a href="#Plate_43">Plate 43</a> is to produce
a more compact surface with a greater impression of length because
of the presence of strongly accented horizontal lines which are always
associated with horizontal divisions. This transitional style with its
minor but dominant horizontal divisions would harmonize with the
long horizontal lines of a room or similar lines in the furniture. The
full expression of this style or type will be readily seen by comparing
<a href="#Plate_43">Plates 43</a> and <a href="#Plate_41">Figures 251</a> and <a href="#Plate_41">252</a>, <a href="#Plate_41">Plate 41</a>. Several styles of
period furniture have been introduced in <a href="#Plate_43">Plate 43</a> to prove the
universality of these principles of space divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dominance
of Lower or
Upper
Sections</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_43">Figures 259</a>, <a href="#Plate_43">260</a>, and <a href="#Plate_43">262</a>, <a href="#Plate_43">Plate 43</a>, are divided by three minor
vertical sections cut by two minor horizontal divisions with the dominance
in the <i>lower section</i>. Rule 2a. The arrangement of the small
central drawers could have been more varied by the application of
the principle of sequential progression. <a href="#Plate_43">Figures 261</a> and <a href="#Plate_43">263</a> show
similar vertical spacings with a difference in the arrangements of the
horizontal divisions. In these figures the dominance has been placed
in the <i>upper section</i> of the primary mass by the division created by the
runner above the lower drawer. It is likewise seen that <a href="#Plate_43">Figure 263</a>
needs a top appendage to bind the top into closer unity with minor
spacings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transitional
Types</div>

<p>In carrying the transitional type to which we have referred in
the previous paragraphs from the vertical space influence toward
the horizontal, we are gradually approaching <i>three minor horizontal
divisions</i>, still maintaining three minor vertical divisions in a modified
and less prominent form. <a href="#Plate_43">Figure 264</a> is an approach toward three
horizontal divisions. As only one clear-cut horizontal space division
is visible, this figure is not a pure example. The upper horizontal
space division is broken up into a three-part design by the drawer
guides. It is not until we reach <a href="#Plate_44">Figure 266</a> that three horizontal
divisions are clearly evident.</p>


<h3 class="section">Horizontal Divisions</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Three Minor
Horizontal
Divisions Cut
by Varying
Numbers of
Vertical
Divisions</div>

<p>The horizontal minor divisions in furniture are generally drawer
runners and the vertical minor divisions are often drawer guides.
The horizontal divisions may be arranged in either one of two ways:
first, by the application of Rule 2b; or second, by applying Rule 2c,
the rule of sequential progression. <a href="#Plate_44">Figures 266</a>, <a href="#Plate_44">267</a>, and <a href="#Plate_44">268</a>,
<a href="#Plate_44">Plate 44</a>, are representative of the former while <a href="#Plate_44">Figures 269</a> and <a href="#Plate_44">270</a>
are typical of the latter. The result in either case is a compactly
designed and solid mass of simple structural lines. On some occasions
we find the three-part rule used for minor divisions within the horizontal
sections, while again the two-part rule is used. The method
depends upon the desired use and appearance. In either case the
long areas and large masses are to be retained as far as possible
near the bottom of each primary mass, as this custom tends to give
a sense of solidity to the design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Four

<p><a href="#Plate_44">Figure 271</a> is a rare reversion to more than three vertical divisions.
In this case, Rule 3c has been observed and we find all of the panels
are of equal size. Variety has been secured by means of the
horizontal spacings.</p>


<h3 class="section">Free Balance</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Free Minor
Space
Treatment<br /><br />Free Balance</div>

<p>This form of design is inherent in the Japanese system. It consists
in the planning and balancing of unequal areas over a geometric
center. It is not subject to definite rules as is the more formal
balancing. The reader is referred to Mr. Arthur Dow's excellent
book on Composition for further discussion of the subject.
<a href="#Plate_45">Figure 272</a>, <a href="#Plate_45">Plate 45</a>, is an example of partly formal and partly free balance
and its method of treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carving
and Piercing
as Applied to
Large Masses</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_45">Figures 273</a> and <a href="#Plate_45">274</a> are pierced designs, thoroughly related to the
structure and in no way weakening it. <a href="#Plate_45">Figure 273</a> is representative
of a type which, if carried to extremes, will cause the structure to
become too weak for service; it is, therefore, necessary to guard and
restrict this form of enrichment. The carving of <a href="#Plate_45">Figure 275</a>, combined
with the contour enrichment, forms a pleasing variation to this
common type of furniture design.</p>

<p>Small minor details in furniture construction should be designed
with as much care as the larger major or minor parts. The larger
areas or spaces in small details similar to stationery shelves and pigeon
holes must harmonize in proportion with the space in which they are
placed and of which they are a part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Small Minor
Details of
Large Primary
Masses</div>

<p>The three-part or three-vertical division system, Rule 3b, is
generally used to design the small details in furniture as may be seen
in <a href="#Plate_45">Figures 276</a>, <a href="#Plate_45">277</a>, <a href="#Plate_45">278</a>, and <a href="#Plate_45">279</a>; while the rule of sequence, Rule 2c,
may be employed again to subdivide these small details in a horizontal
direction with as much variety as is consistent with unity. <a href="#Plate_45">Figure
280</a> is a leaded glass surface enrichment for doors. Note the leading
lines of the enrichment as they parallel the dominant proportions
of the panel opening.</p>

SURFACE ENRICHMENT OF CLAY</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Limitations
for Surface
Enrichment</div>

<p>In some respects the surface enrichment of clay is similar to
that of wood as, for example, the similarity produced by inlays in
clay and in wood. On the other hand the enrichment of clay is
unhampered by the restricting effects of unequal resistance of the
material, such as the grain of wood. Again it <i>is</i> limited to those
effects or forms of enrichment that are capable of withstanding the
intense heat to which ceramic decoration is subjected. See Frontispiece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decorative
Processes of

</div>

<p>Before proceeding with a design it is well for one to understand
clearly the possibilities of clay enrichment. He must know what
kind of designs are best suited to clay as a medium, to the intended
service, and to the ultimate application of the heat of the pottery kiln.
Without entering into technicalities let us briefly discuss the following
processes.
The first three deal with finger and tool manipulation
of the clay body and are consequently the simpler of the processes.
The last five are concerned chiefly with the addition of coloring
pigments either to the clay or to the glaze and are, therefore, more
complex in character.</p>

<h3 class="section">Processes</h3>

<p>Rule 9a. <i>Surface enrichment of clay must be so designed as to be
able to withstand the action of heat to which all ware must be submitted.</i></p>

<p>Rule 9b. <i>Incised, pierced, and modeled decoration in clay should
be simple and bold and thus adapted to the character of the material.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Incising</div>

<p>1. This is the simplest form of enrichment, a process familiar
to the earliest primitive potters and appropriate now for beginners.
It consists of the process of lowering lines or planes into the clay body
to the depth of from one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch. These
lines or planes should be bold and broad. They may be made with
a blunt pencil or a flat pointed stick. A square, rectangular, or
round stick may be used as a stamp with which to form a pattern for
incising. Illustrations of simple incising may be found in Figures
<a href="#Plate_47">283</a>, <a href="#Plate_47">284</a>, <a href="#Plate_47">295</a>,
<a href="#Plate_50">319</a>, <a href="#Plate_50">330</a>. The tiles shown are about six inches square.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piercing</div>

<p>2. This process is less common and, as its name implies, is carried
out by cutting through the clay. It may be done with a fine wire.
Either the background or the design itself may be thus removed.
The effect produced is that of lightening an object such as the top
of a hanging flower holder, a window flower box, or a lantern shade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modeling</div>

<p>3. By adding clay to the main body, and by working this clay
into low relief flower or geometric forms, one has the basic process of
modeling. The slightly raised areas of clay form a pleasing play
of light and shade that varies the otherwise plain surface of the ware.
The process should be used with caution, for over-modeling, Figure
<a href="#Plate_50">325</a>, will obstruct the structural outlines and, because of its over
prominence as decoration, will cease to be <i>surface enrichment</i>. In
the technical language of the designer over-modeling is an enrichment
which is not subordinated to the surface. In articles intended for
service this high relief modeling is unsanitary and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_47">Figures 286</a> and <a href="#Plate_47">287</a> show incising with slight modeling, while
<a href="#Plate_50">324</a>, <a href="#Plate_50">328</a>, and <a href="#Plate_50">329</a> are examples of more complex enrichment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction
of Coloring
Pigments</div>

<p>With the introduction of the second group comes an added interest
and difficulty, that of the introduction of color. Pigments that will
withstand the application of heat are suggested at different points.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inlay</div>

<p>4. This process consists of removing certain areas from the clay
body to the depth of one-eighth inch and filling in the depression with
tinted clay. Tints formed by the addition of ten per cent or less of
burnt umber or yellow ochre to the modeling clay will give interesting
effects. <a href="#Plate_47">Figures 284</a>, <a href="#Plate_47">285</a>, <a href="#Plate_50">320</a>, and <a href="#Plate_50">321</a> show forms which may be
developed by this process.</p>

<p>Sgraffito, an Italian process, is more difficult than inlaying, but
the effect is similar. A thin layer of colored clay is placed over the
natural clay body, and the design is developed by cutting away this
colored coating in places, thus exposing the natural clay body.
<a href="#Plate_48">Figure 306</a>. There are variations of this plan that may be attempted
by the advanced designer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slip
Painting</div>

<p>5. Slip is clay mixed with water to the consistency of cream.
For slip painting this mixture is thoroughly mixed with not more than
ten per cent of coloring pigment as represented by the underglaze
colors of the ceramist. This thick, creamy, colored slip is then
painted on the surface of the clay body while damp, much as the
artist would apply oil colors. The ware, when thoroughly dried,
is glazed and fired, which produces the effect shown in <a href="#Plate_47">Figures 290</a>,
<a href="#Plate_47">291</a>, and <a href="#Plate_50">327</a>. The color range is large; almost any color may be used
with the exception of reds and strong yellows. A colorless transparent
glaze should be used over beginner's slip painting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colored
Glazes</div>

<p>6. This process refers to the direct introduction of the colored
pigment into the glaze. By varying the glaze formula we may have
a clear, transparent, or glossy glaze similar to <a href="#Plate_49">Figure 317</a>, a dull
surfaced opaque effect, termed a matt glaze, <a href="#Plate_50">Figure 332</a>; or a glossy
but opaque faience glaze similar to the blue and white Dutch tiles.
There are other forms such as the crystalline and "reduced" glazes,
but these as a rule are far beyond the ability of the beginning craftsman
in ceramics.</p>

alt="Surface Enrichment of Clay. Shallow Circular Forms: Plates, etc." />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 48</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Combinations</div>

<p>It is possible to use these three types of glazed surface in various
ways. For example, a vase form with an interesting contour may be
left without further surface enrichment except that supplied by clear
glaze or by a colored matt similar to certain types of Teco Ware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
It is likewise possible to apply transparent glazes over incised designs,
inlay or slip painting, increasing their beauty and the serviceability
of the ware. A semi-transparent glaze is sometimes placed over slip
painting giving the charm inherent to the Vellum Ware of the Rookwood
Potteries. <a href="#Plate_50">Figure 332</a>. Greens, blues, yellows, and browns,
with their admixtures, are the safest combinations for the craftsman
who desires to mix his own glazes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Underglaze
Painting</div>

<p>7. This process may be seen in the examples of Newcomb Pottery
illustrated particularly in <a href="#Plate_49">Figure 314</a> or <a href="#Plate_50">326</a>. The underglaze
pigment is thinly painted upon the fired "biscuit," or unglazed ware.
A thin, transparent glaze is then placed <i>over</i> the color, and in the final
firing the underneath color shows through this transparent coating,
thus illustrating the origin of the name underglaze or under-the-glaze
painting. Sage-green and cobalt-blue underglaze colors are frequently
used in Newcomb designs with harmonious results. The
outline of the design is often incised and the underglaze color, settling
into these channels, helps to accentuate the design. <a href="#Plate_49">Figure 314</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Porcelain
or Overglaze
Painting</div>

<p>8. This is popularly known as china painting and consists of
painting directly upon the glazed surface of the ware and placing
it in a china kiln where a temperature between 600 degrees and 900
degrees C. is developed. At this point the coloring pigment melts
or is fused into the porcelain glaze, thus insuring its reasonable
permanence. <a href="#Plate_48">Figure 302</a>.</p>

<p>The eight processes briefly described may be readily identified
on the plates by referring to the figures corresponding to those
which number the processes and are added to each figure number.
Two processes are sometimes suggested as possible for one problem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classification
of Structural
Clay Forms</div>

<p>Different clay forms require different modes of treatment. To
simplify these treatments will now be our problem. It has been found
convenient to form four divisions based upon the general geometric
shape of the ware. The first, <a href="#Plate_47">Plate 47</a>, includes rectangular and
square areas; the second, <a href="#Plate_48">Plate 48</a>, shallow and circular forms;
the third, <a href="#Plate_49">Plate 49</a>, low cylindrical forms; and the fourth, <a href="#Plate_50">Plate 50</a>,
high cylindrical forms. The first three divisions have distinct modes
of design treatment, while the fourth interlocks to a considerable
extent with the third method. We shall now consider each plate
with reference to its use and possible forms of enrichment. For the
sake of brevity, the results have been condensed into tabulated forms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_49" style="width: 500px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Each geometric form or type on these plates has not only distinctive
methods of design treatment but characteristic locations for
placing the design as well. These places or zones of enrichment have
been indicated in the following tabulated forms by the letters in
parentheses. There are a number of zones for each plate. For
example, <a href="#Plate_47">Plate 47</a> has its distinctive problems as tiles, weights, etc.,
and five characteristic zones of enrichment described on <a href="#Page_153">pages 153</a>-<a href="#Page_155">155</a>
and indicated by the letters A, B, C, D, E, followed by a
brief description of that zone. Each zone is still further analyzed
into its accompanying type of design, inceptive axis, point of concentration,
and illustrations. Each plate has the proper zone of
enrichment immediately following the figure number and in turn
followed by the process number.</p>

SURFACE ENRICHMENT OF PRECIOUS METALS</h2>

<h3 class="section">Small Flat Planes</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Base and
Precious
Metals</div>

<p><a href="#Chap_XII">Chapter XII</a> referred to clay as a free and plastic material adapted
to a wide range of surface enrichment processes. Metal as a more
refractory material offers greater resistance to the craftsman and is
relatively more limited in its capacity for surface enrichment. As
was the case in the consideration of contour enrichment for designing
purposes, it is necessary in the consideration of surface enrichment
to divide metal into two groups: precious and base metals. As the
field of design in both base and precious metals is large, we shall consider
the surface enrichment of <i>precious metals only</i> in this chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divisions
for
Enrichment</div>

<p>Following an order similar in character to that used in clay
designing, problems in both base and precious metals may be divided
into four classified groups as follows: flat, square, rectangular, or
irregular planes; shallow circular forms; low cylindrical forms;
high cylindrical forms. Designs included in the first group, flat
planes, comprise such problems as are typically represented by tie
pins, fobs, rings, and pendants. The design problems presented by
these examples are so important that it is wise to restrict this chapter
to <i>flat planes</i>.</p>

<p>Rule 10g. <i>The inceptive axis should pass through and coincide
with one axis of a stone, and at the same time be sympathetically related
to the structure.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10h. <i>The position of the inceptive axis should be determined
by: (1) use of the project as ring, pendant, or bar pin, (2) character of
the primary mass as either vertical or horizontal in proportion.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Inceptive
Axes and
Points of
Concentration</div>
<p>The semi-precious or precious stone is commonly found to be the
point of concentration of these designs. The inceptive axes of tie
pins, pendants, and fobs are generally vertical center lines because of
the vertical positions of the objects when worn. The inceptive axes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
moreover, should pass through the point of concentration and, at the
same time, be sympathetically related to the structure. Rings and
bar pins are frequently designed with horizontal inceptive axes, so
determined by their horizontal characteristics and positions.</p>

<p>The point of concentration for tie pins, pendants, and fobs in
formal balance, in addition to coinciding with the inceptive axis, is
generally located above or below the geometric center of the primary
mass. The point of concentration for rings and bar pins is placed
in the horizontal inceptive axis and centrally located from left to
right.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Typical
Processes of
Enrichment<br /><br />Economy of Material</div>

<p>As a step preliminary to designing, and in order that the enrichment
may be conventionalized or adapted to conform to the requirements
of tools, processes, and materials, it is now imperative to become
familiar with a number of common forms of surface enrichment in
metal. There are eight processes frequently encountered in the
decoration of silver and gold: piercing, etching, chasing or repousséing,
enameling, inlaying, stone setting, building, carving. To these may
be added planishing, frosting or matting, and oxidizing as methods
employed to enrich the entire surface.
Economy of material is
of prime importance in the designing of precious metal and, particularly
in gold projects, conservation of the metals should be an urgent
consideration in all designs.</p>

<p>Rule 10a. <i>Designs in precious metals should call for the minimum
amount of metal necessary to express the idea of the designer for two
reasons: (1) good taste; (2) economy of material.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evolution and
Technical
Rendering of
Processes</div>

<p>A non-technical and brief description of each process follows.
All designs in this chapter may be identified by referring to the process
numbers after the figure description as 1, 3, 5; 2, 4, 6, corresponding
to the key numbers on <a href="#Plate_52">Plate 52</a>. A design to be submitted to the
craftsman should be a graphic <i>record of technical facts</i> in addition to
good design, which requires that we should have an expressive
<i>technical means of rendering each process</i>. The last column, on <a href="#Plate_52">Plate
52</a>, indicates this rendering. In addition to this rendering each one
of the eight technical processes has been carried through three design
steps. 1. (first column, <a href="#Plate_52">Plate 52</a>) Planning the original primary
mass, with its inceptive axis suggested by the structure and intended
use. It passes through the point of concentration. 2. (second column, <a href="#Plate_52">Plate 52</a>).
The division of the primary mass into zones of
service and enrichment with the suggestion of the leading lines which,
at some points, are parallel to the contours and lead up to the point
of concentration. The contours in this column have, in several
instances, been changed to add lightness and variety to the problem.
3. The last step (column three, <a href="#Plate_52">Plate 52</a>) shows the design with
graphic rendering suggestive of the completed process.</p>

<span class="smcap">Technical Processes and Methods of Illustrating Same
in a Design</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Piercing</div>

<p>1. Removal of design unit or background by means of the
jeweler's saw. Bridges of metal should be left to support firmly
all portions of the design. Test this by careful study of the design.
Rendering&mdash;shade all pierced portions of the design in solid black.
Slightly tint portions of the design passing under other parts. Illustration,
<a href="#Plate_52">Figure 336</a>.</p>

<p>Rule 10j. <i>All surface enrichment should have an appearance of
compactness or unity. Pierced spots or areas should be so used as to
avoid the appearance of having been scattered on the surface without
thought to their coherence.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Etching</div>

<p>2. Coating either design or background with an acid resistant,
to be followed by immersion of the article in an acid bath. Allow
the unprotected portion to be attacked and eaten by the acid to a
slight depth. Rendering&mdash;slightly tint all depressed or etched parts
of the design. Illustration, <a href="#Plate_52">Figure 339</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chasing or
Repousséing</div>

<p>3. The embossing and fine embellishment of a metal surface by
the application of the hammer and punches. The work is conducted
mainly from the top surface. Rendering&mdash;stipple all parts of
the background not raised by the process. Chasing should seem an
integral part of the background and not appear stuck upon it. Illustration,
<a href="#Plate_52">Figure 342</a>. Rule 10k.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enameling
(Champleve)</div>

<p>4. A process of enameling over metal in which the ground is cut
away into a series of shallow troughs into which the enamel is melted.
Exercise reserve in the use of enamel. Over-decoration tends to
cheapen this valuable form of decoration. Rendering&mdash;shade the
lower and right-hand sides of all enameled areas to suggest relief.
Illustration, <a href="#Plate_52">Figure 345</a>. If possible render in tempera color.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Plate 53</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Rule 10i. <i>Caution should be exercised with regard to the use of
enamel. Over-decoration by this material tends to cheapen both process
and design.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10l. <i>The lanes or margins between enameled spots should be
narrower than the lane or margin between the enamel and the contour
of the primary mass.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Inlaying</div>

<p>5. The process of applying wire, etc., to an incision on metal
either by burnishing or fusing the metal into the cavities. Rendering&mdash;tint
the darker metal or, if possible, render in color. Illustration,
<a href="#Plate_52">Figure 348</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stone
Cutting</div>

<p>6. An enrichment of the surface by the addition of semi-precious
or precious stones. Other enrichment is generally subordinated to
the stone which then becomes the point of concentration. All
enrichment should lead toward the stone. Small stones may, however,
be used to accentuate other points of concentration in surface
enrichment. Rendering&mdash;shade the lower and right-side of the stone
to suggest relief. Pierced subordinate enrichment should be shaded
in solid black. A concentric line should be drawn outside of the
contour of the stone to designate the thin holding band, or bezel,
enclosing the stone on all sides. Illustration, <a href="#Plate_52">Figure 351</a>.</p>

<p>Rule 10d. <i>Surface enrichment should at some point parallel the
contours of both primary mass and point of concentration, especially
whenever the latter is a stone or enamel.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10e. <i>In the presence of either stone or enamel as a point of
concentration, surface enrichment should be regarded as an unobtrusive
setting, or background.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10f. <i>Stone or enamel used as a point of concentration should
form contrast with the metal, either in color, brilliancy, or value, or all
three combined.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Building</div>

<p>7. The process of applying leaves, wire, grains, and other forms
of surface enrichment to the plane of the metal. These may afterwards
be carved or chased. Rendering&mdash;shade the lower and
right-hand lines; slightly tint the lower planes of the metal. Illustration,
<a href="#Plate_52">Figure 354</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Carving</div>
<p>8. The process of depressing or raising certain portions of the
metal surface by means of chisels and gravers. By the use of these
tools the surface is modeled into planes of light and shade, to which
interest is added if the unaggressive tool marks are permitted to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
on the surface. Rendering&mdash;shade the raised and depressed portions
to express the modeling planes. As this is a difficult technical process
the designer is advised to model the design in plastelene or
jewelers' wax first. Illustration, <a href="#Plate_52">Figure 357</a>.</p>

<p>Rule 10k. <i>Built, carved, and chased enrichment should have the
higher planes near the point of concentration. It is well to have the
stone as the highest point above the primary mass. When using this
form of enrichment, the stone should never appear to rise abruptly from
the primary mass, but should be approached by a series of rising planes.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Planishing</div>

<p>9. The process of smoothing and, at the same time, hardening
the surface of the metal with a steel planishing hammer. The hammer
strokes give an interesting texture to the surface which may be
varied, from the heavily indented to the smooth surface, at the will
of the craftsman. The more obvious hammer strokes are not to be
desired as they bring a tool process into too much prominence for
good taste. Rendering&mdash;print desired finish on the drawing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frosting</div>

<p>10. A process of sand blasting or scratch brushing a metal
surface to produce an opaque or "satin" finish. Rendering&mdash;similar
to planishing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxidizing</div>

<p>11. A process of darkening the surface of metal by the application
of chemicals. Potassium sulphite will supply a deep, rich black to
silver and copper. Rendering&mdash;see Planishing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Design of
Pins and
Brooches</div>

<p>The eleven processes mentioned above are among those which,
by recent common practice, have become familiar to the craftsman
in precious metals. While they do not cover the entire field, they
at least give the beginner an opportunity to design intelligently in
terms of the material.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dependent
Surface
Enrichment
for Pins</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_53">Plate 53</a> is mainly the enrichment of the flat plane by the addition
of semi-precious stones (process six). Whatever surface enrichment
is added to this design becomes <i>dependent</i> enrichment and quite
analogous to <i>dependent</i> contour enrichment, <a href="#Plate_29">Plate 29</a>, inasmuch as
it has to be designed with special reference to the shape and character
of the stone. <a href="#Plate_53">Figures 358</a> to <a href="#Plate_53">363</a> are examples of <i>dependent contour</i>
enrichment; <a href="#Plate_53">Figures 364</a> to <a href="#Plate_53">371</a> are examples of <i>dependent surface</i>
enrichment. <a href="#Plate_53">Figures 358</a> to <a href="#Plate_53">367</a> are based upon <i>vertical</i> inceptive
axes as appropriate to their intended service. The point of concentration
may be located at practically any point on this inceptive
axis, provided the major axis of the stone coincides with the inceptive
axis. The best results are obtained by placing the stone a little
above or below the exact geometrical center of the primary mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Inceptive Axes for Pins</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_53">Figures 368</a> to <a href="#Plate_53">372</a> show articles based upon a horizontal inceptive
axis. The stone, in accordance with formal balance, is in the geometric
center from left to right. One notices the important fact that
the surface enrichment must bring the stone and contour together
in sympathetic relation and, at the same time, be related to both
stone and contour. This again brings out the meaning of <i>dependent</i>
surface enrichment. The contour enrichment is to be kept as simple
as possible and the interest concentrated upon the surface enrichment.
The <i>accentuation of both surface and contour enrichment</i> in a single
design marks the height of bad taste in design.</p>

<p>Rule 10b. <i>Contour and surface enrichment should never appear
to compete for attention in the same design.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fobs</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_54">Plate 54</a> shows flat planes, the service of which suggests vertical
inceptive axes. <a href="#Plate_54">Figure 380</a> is noted as an exception to this vertical
inceptive axis as it possesses a vertical primary mass but with radial
inceptive axes. The interesting manner by which the dynamic
leaves of the outer border transmit their movement to the inner
border, which in turn leads toward the point of concentration, is
worthy of attention. The points of concentration in other designs
on this plate are all contained in the vertical inceptive axes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rings</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_55">Plate 55</a>, at first thought, would seem to fall under the classification
of low cylindrical forms but when reference is made to <a href="#Plate_55">Figure
385</a> it is readily seen that the ring has to be first developed as a flat
plane, to be afterwards bent into the required form. Care should be
taken to keep the design narrow enough to be visible when the ring
is in position on the finger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_55" style="width: 500px;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

alt="Surface Enrichment of Small Primary Masses in Precious Metal. Enrichment of Flat Planes. Rings" />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 55</p>
</div>

<p>The long horizontal band of the ring supplies the motive for the
horizontal inceptive axis as a common basis or starting point for a
large number of designs. If the designer so desires, the vertical
axis of the finger is authority for an elliptical stone to be placed with
its major axis as a vertical line in harmony with the finger axis. In
any instance the designer seeks to lead the eye from the horizontal
portion of the ring (the finger band) toward the point of concentration
(the stone), by means of surface enrichment. A long sloping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
contour curve helps, as a transition line in the boundary, to carry
the attention from the stone to the finger band. A great number of
devices are used to complete a similar transition in the surface
enrichment. <a href="#Fig_390a">Figure 390a</a>. Too much piercing weakens the structure,
and it is therefore to be avoided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig_390a" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 390a.&mdash;Rings</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_56">Plate 56</a> suggests some vertical flat planes for pendants. While
no definite rule can be stated for the location of the stone, from past
experience, it is easier for beginners to place the stone on the vertical
inceptive axis slightly above the geometric center of the primary
mass. <a href="#Plate_56">Figures 391</a> to <a href="#Plate_56">395</a>. A design thus formed is less likely to
appear heavy, although there is nothing arbitrary about the
suggestion.</p>

<p>Rule 10c. <i>Parts of a design differing in function should differ in
appearance but be co-ordinated with the entire design.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_56" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption smcap">Plate 56</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Pendants and Chains</div>

<p>In pendant design the surface enrichment generally carries the
attention from the contour of the pendant to the stone, thus insuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
unity at this point, while the contour lines often lead the attention
from the pendant to the chain. The eye should move in unbroken
dynamic movement from pendant to chain. The chain may have
points of accent designed to vary the even distribution of the links.
These accents are frequently composed of small stones with surface
enrichment sympathetically designed in unity with pendant, chain,
and stone. <a href="#Plate_56">Figure 401</a> shows examples of this arrangement and
similarly the need of a horizontal inceptive axis to harmonize with the
length of the chain. These small accents are quite similar in design
to bar pin motives.</p>

<p>Rule 10m. <i>Transparent and opaque stones or enamel should not
be used in the same design.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation
of Stones
to Metal</div>

<p>For the designer's purposes we may consider two kinds of stones,
the transparent and the opaque. These should not be mixed in one
design. The most favorable stones are those forming contrasts
of value or brilliancy with the metal as, for example, the amethyst,
lapis lazuli, or New Zealand jade, with silver; or the dark topaz, or
New Zealand jade, with gold. Lack of these contrasts gives dull,
monotonous effects that fail to make the stone the point of concentration.
<a href="#Plate_66">Figure 467</a>. These effects may be partially overcome by
frosting, plating, or oxidizing the metal, thus forming stronger contrasts
of value.</p>

SURFACE ENRICHMENT OF LARGE PRIMARY MASSES
IN BASE AND PRECIOUS METALS</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
for Small
Areas</div>

<p>The surface enrichment of small, flat primary masses treated in
<a href="#Chap_XIII">Chapter XIII</a> emphasized the designer's tendency for <i>full</i> surface
enrichment of small areas. Such treatment has proved satisfactory
because the eye can readily and immediately observe and comprehend
or assimilate an enrichment upon a small area. For larger enriched
areas considered in this chapter, full surface enrichment becomes a
questionable policy for the following reasons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enrichment
for Large
Areas</div>

<p>It is true that the old time craftsman with consummate skill fully
enriched large surfaces, but two factors interfere with this mode of
treatment today. The first factor is the decidedly practical nature
of the problem. The service to which the modern industrial project
is put interferes with the use of full surface enrichment. The second
is the lack of skill on the part of the modern amateur designer. It is
a sound policy to avoid the ornateness that frequently accompanies a
large and unskillfully planned area. In place of this, we should
limit the enrichment of large masses to a few salient areas which

<p>Rule 11b. <i>Conservative application should mark the use of surface
enrichment of large masses. Its use should:</i> (1) <i>lighten or soften necessarily
heavy construction;</i> (2) <i>support or apparently strengthen good
structure;</i> (3) <i>add interest to large unbroken and uninteresting surfaces.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Essentials
of Good
Surface
Enrichment</div>

<p>These salient areas should determine the surface enrichment
appropriate to the structure, so that the enrichment: (1) will lighten
or soften necessarily heavy construction as in <a href="#Plate_58">Figure 403</a>; (2) support
or apparently strengthen good structure, <a href="#Plate_59">Figure 413</a>; (3) add interest
to large unbroken or otherwise uninteresting surfaces as illustrated
in <a href="#Plate_58">Figure 405</a>. To aid in producing the desired results, we have the
technical processes mentioned in <a href="#Chap_XIII">Chapter XIII</a> as follows: (1) Piercing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
(2) Etching; (3) Chasing; (4) Enameling; (5) Inlaying; (6) Stone setting;
(7) Building; (8) Carving; (9) Planishing; (10) Frosting;
(11) Oxidizing. On the plates for this chapter, the figure generally

<h3 class="section">Surface Design Evolution</h3>

<p>Rule 11a. <i>The preliminary steps toward surface enrichment should
be thought out before they are drawn.</i></p>

<p>A designer will be materially helped if he devotes a few moments
of thought to his design problem before he applies the pencil to the
paper. In the end the time given to thinking out his problem will
gain for him both increased excellence of design and rapidity of
execution, provided his thinking is systematic. A sequential order
of points to be observed is given below. The object of systematic
thought is to form a mental picture of the enrichment to be in full
accord with the materials and construction and to be sympathetically
related to the structural axes and to the contours. The unenriched
mass has been designed and we are now ready for the consideration of
surface enrichment in the following order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary of
Steps in
Surface
Enrichment</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Placing the Zone of Service.</i></p>

<p>1. Where is the zone of service?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Classification of Form</i>.</p>

<p>1. Is the object flat, shallow and circular, low and cylindrical,
high and cylindrical?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Placing the Zone of Enrichment.</i></p>

<p>1. Is the enrichment to be seen from above or from the side? See
<a href="#Fig_406a">Figure 406a</a>.</p>

<p>2. What point of the structure suggested by the form needs
surface enrichment? Is it the primary mass, appendages, terminals,
links, or details? Let the area selected become the zone of enrichment.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Amount of Enrichment.</i></p>

<p>1. Will the enrichment cover the full surface, part surface (center
or margin), or accented outline?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Location of Inceptive Axis.</i></p>

<p>1. Is the zone of enrichment associated with a square, rectangle,
hexagon, or irregularly shaped flat plane, circular or cylindrical
surface? <a href="#Fig_470">Figure 470</a>.</p>

<p>2. How should the inceptive axis be placed in the zone of
enrichment to harmonize with the structural forms suggested by
1 (e) and the point from which it is viewed 1 (c)? See the violation
of this latter point in <a href="#Plate_61">Figure 439</a>. Presumably this inceptive axis
will be a vertical center line, horizontal center line, diagonal, diameter,
radius, the element of a cylinder, or a dynamic curve for a free border.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Point of Concentration.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Surface
Enrichment</div>

<p>1. Where should the point of concentration be located upon
the inceptive axis?</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>Unison of Enrichment and Materials.</i></p>

<p>1. What decorative process will be adaptable to service, the
material, and the contemplated design?</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>Type of Units</i>.</p>

<p>1. What design units are suited to the process selected in (<i>g</i>),
appropriate to the texture and structural lines of the form to be
enriched and to its ultimate service? Choice may be made from
nature, geometric pattern, or historic ornament.</p>

<p>The above points may all be <i>thought out</i>. Now, with some assurance,
the designer may take his pencil and begin to <i>draw</i> the units
in their proper position upon or about the inceptive axis with the
point of concentration correctly placed in position in the inceptive
axis. Rules and suggestions for this execution have been previously
given.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) <i>Designing of the Units</i>.</p>

<p>1. How should the units be drawn to be in harmony with the
inceptive axis, the contours, and to each other?</p>

<p>The above points of approach to surface enrichment represent
a logical reasoning process which supplies a line of sequential and
developmental pictures that will reduce to a minimum the element
of doubt and fog through which the average designer approaches
his problem. The steps will, in time, become practically automatic
and may be thought out in a surprisingly short period of time.</p>

<p>Rule 11c. <i>The type of design unit for large masses should be bolder
than similar designs for small primary masses.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Large
Masses and
Their
Treatment</div>

<p>As may be expected from briefly considering the illustrations for
this chapter as compared with those for small primary masses,
<a href="#Chap_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>, it is seen that the units for base and precious metals
are larger and bolder than those used for smaller masses. The more
effective designs are those whose appropriateness, simplicity, and
correct structural proportions and relations appeal to our sense of
fitness and beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Large Flat

Surfaces

Plate&nbsp;58</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_58">Figures 403</a>, <a href="#Plate_58">404</a>, and <a href="#Plate_58">406</a> are composed of projects designed
mainly on vertical inceptive axes or center lines. The freely balanced
natural units in <a href="#Plate_58">Figure 403</a> have the zone of enrichment in the upper
portion of the appendage (handles), and the point of concentration
in the upper portion of the zone of enrichment. Formal symmetrical
balance controls the placing of enrichment in <a href="#Plate_58">Figure 404</a>. Initial
letters, through lack of consideration of design principles, are frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
misplaced on masses with little or no consideration given
to their mass relations with the structural contours. As a contrast
to this, notice the carefully considered relations between the letter
<i>W</i> on the tea strainer in <a href="#Plate_58">Figure 404</a> and its adaptation to the contours
of the appendage. The stone enrichment on the handle of
the paper cutter in <a href="#Plate_58">Figure 404</a> in no way interferes with its use as a
cutter and is therefore appropriate as surface enrichment.</p>

<p>The pierced enrichment of the silver box in <a href="#Plate_58">Figure 405</a> contains
vertical and horizontal lines which bring the decorative human
figures into harmonious relation with the structural contours. <a href="#Plate_58">Figure
406</a> shows both formal and free balance with center and full surface
zones of enrichment. <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> could have been improved by a
more strongly marked point of concentration which would have
added more character to the designs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flat and
Semi-flat
Surfaces in
Base Metal,
Plate&nbsp;59</div>

<p>In <a href="#Chap_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>, the contour terminal enrichment problem was
described at some length. Many illustrations on Plates <a href="#Plate_58">58</a>, <a href="#Plate_59">59</a>, and
<a href="#Plate_59">60</a> are, in a way, similar in their type of surface decoration, which is
termed <i>surface terminal enrichment</i>. The "happy ending" mentioned
in <a href="#Chap_VIII">Chapter VIII</a> as a suitable means of terminating the contour
of a long primary mass or appendage may be similarly treated by
suitable surface enrichment, particularly shown in <a href="#Plate_58">Figures 403</a>, <a href="#Plate_58">404</a>,
<a href="#Plate_59">407</a>, <a href="#Plate_59">408</a>, <a href="#Plate_59">409</a>, and <a href="#Plate_59">410</a>. The terminal is quite common as a zone
of enrichment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contour
<i>Versus</i>
Surface
Enrichment</div>

<p>It is readily seen that when surface enrichment is the prevailing
decorative theme it becomes necessary to subordinate contour
enrichment to it, Rule 10b, otherwise the strife for dominance
arising between these two forms of enrichment will lead to poor and
ornate design, <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 417</a>. Whatever contour enrichment is used
must be chosen to accord with the surface enrichment, Rule 10d, as
noted in the preceding figures and in <a href="#Plate_59">Figure 411</a>. Here we find the
closest connection, as the chased forms of the surface at many points
merge into the contour. Thus surface and contour are bound together
in unity with the surface enrichment, which maintains its
dominance throughout.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surface
Enrichment
of Hardware,
Plate 60</div>

<p>The simple and dignified treatment of the fire set in <a href="#Plate_59">Figure 413</a>
is synonymous with the finest type of enrichment for service and
beauty, Rule 11b. The peacock motives of <a href="#Plate_59">Figures 414</a> and <a href="#Plate_59">415</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
are applied to the desk set. The motives as used in this case are
generally well adapted to their respective areas and inceptive axes.</p>

<p>Rule 11f. <i>Repulsive forms should not be introduced into surface
enrichment.</i></p>

<p><a href="#Plate_60">Figure 417</a> is a typical example of over-ornamentation with the
surface and contour enrichment struggling in deadly conflict for
prominence. In the combat, the natural structural axis has been
totally neglected for irrelevant and disconnected ornament. <a href="#Plate_60">Figure
418</a> illustrates correctly related surface ornament, with a dominance
of the latter form, Rule 10b. <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 419</a> represents a type of decoration
presumably roughened to meet the needs of service. It
proves, however, to be unpleasant to the touch and unnecessary as
the plain knob is preferable in every way. The naturalistic snake
motive of <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 421</a> is repulsive to many people; this and similar
decorative motives should be avoided in preference to the more
conventionalized pattern of <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 422</a>, Rule 11f.</p>

<p>Rule 11e. <i>Two periods of historic ornament should not be introduced
into the same design.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Historic
Ornament
Applied to
Period Hardware
Design
Door Plates</div>

<p>It is impossible to close these chapters without reference to the
influence of the great schools of architectural history upon contemporary
design. There is a growing tendency for manufacturers to
use period patterns in house decorations which correspond to the
design of the building. A Colonial building frequently calls for
Colonial hardware, a Gothic church for corresponding surface enrichment
of that period.</p>

<p>As introductory illustrations, <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 423</a> stands as a simple
example of accented (beveled) contour while <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 424</a> has been
accented with reminiscent moulding appropriate to Colonial architecture.
They might, however, be used with many simply designed
articles of furniture. From this slight indication or portion of a
style, we have a more pronounced beginning in <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 425</a> with its
clearly marked Greek egg and dart ornamental border. The acanthus
leaf of the Byzantine school, <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 426</a>, changes to the geometric
arabesques of the Moorish school in <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 427</a>. The Gothic arch,
cusps, and quatrefoil of <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 428</a> are changed to the classic acanthus
foliage of the French Renaissance period. <a href="#Plate_60">Figure 429</a>. Figures
<a href="#Plate_60">430</a> and <a href="#Plate_60">431</a> are later developments of the Renaissance. The heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
enriched Flemish pattern completes our illustrations of the use of
past forms of ornamentation applied to modern designs. Only a
small number from a rapidly enlarging field of period design are
shown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shallow
Circular
Forms,
Plate 61</div>

<p>With circular plates and trays, the enrichment normally takes the
form of a border (marginal enrichment), with the inceptive axes or
center lines of the repeated units radiating from the center of the
circle. <a href="#Plate_61">Figures 433</a>, <a href="#Plate_61">435</a>, <a href="#Plate_61">436</a>, <a href="#Plate_61">437</a>, <a href="#Plate_61">438</a>, and <a href="#Plate_61">439</a>. An elliptical
form frequently calls for handles and terminal enrichment as shown
by <a href="#Plate_61">Figure 434</a>.</p>

<p>Both <a href="#Plate_61">Figures 437</a> and <a href="#Plate_61">438</a> have divided points of concentration
and would be materially improved by the omission of the center unit
<i>A</i>. The small tree used as a connecting link in the border of <a href="#Plate_61">Figure
437</a> should be reversed, as it now possesses a motion or growth contrary
to the larger tree units. The contour enrichment in <a href="#Plate_61">Figure 438</a>
could well be omitted or moved around to support the surface enrichment.
The pierced enrichment <i>A</i>, <a href="#Plate_61">Figure 439</a>, is incorrectly used
as it is not designed to be seen from above, the normal viewpoint
of the tray. The design should have been based upon the horizontal
axis of the project similar to <a href="#Plate_61">Figure 439</a> at <i>B</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Low
Cylindrical
Forms,
Plate 62</div>

<p>Differing from the shallow plate, with the increased height of
the low cylindrical forms of <a href="#Plate_62">Plate 62</a>, there now develops the possibility
of enriching the sides of this class of project: a zone of enrichment
not readily accessible in the shallow plate form. In addition to
the sides there remain the appendages, quite capable of carrying
enrichment to advantage. One should control the zone of enrichment
in such a manner that the attention will not be equally drawn to both
appendage and primary mass. Two points of enrichment, both
calling for equal attention, divide the interest in the problem, and
cause a lack of unity or oneness.</p>

<p>Rule 11d. <i>The eye should be attracted to one principal zone of
enrichment, whether located upon the primary mass, appendage,
terminals, links, or details. All other zones should be subordinate
to this area.</i></p>

<p>Enrichment upon the appendages may be found in <a href="#Plate_62">Figures 440</a>,
<a href="#Plate_62">441</a>, <a href="#Plate_62">442</a>, <a href="#Plate_62">445</a>, and on the upper portion of the straight sides of the
primary mass in <a href="#Plate_62">Figures 443</a> and <a href="#Plate_62">444</a>. The decorative units composing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the border on these straight sides are designed upon the
vertical element of the underlying cylindrical form as the inceptive
axis. The enrichment for the appendage is well related to the
contour of that member and is commonly based upon the center line
of the appendage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cylindrical
Forms,
Plate&nbsp;63</div>

<p>The principles of enriching these higher cylindrical forms in many
ways closely parallel those which govern the lower cylindrical forms.
The inceptive axes of the decoration on the two vases of Figures
<a href="#Plate_63">446</a> and <a href="#Plate_63">447</a> may be readily analyzed as vertical elements of the
cylinder. <a href="#Plate_63">Figures 448</a> and <a href="#Plate_63">449</a> are quite rare exceptions of the accentuation
of the <i>vertical</i> lines of the cylinder. Horizontal bands
similar to <a href="#Plate_62">Figures 444</a> and <a href="#Plate_63">447</a> are more common interpretations of
cylinder enrichment. <a href="#Plate_63">Figure 450</a> marks a successful combination
of two dissimilar materials with the shade (appendage) as the dominating
enriched member. Rule 10c.</p>

<p>The small chased bosses used as enrichment in <a href="#Plate_63">Figure 452</a> are
re-echoed on the several pieces of the set which binds them into
collective unity. The top portion of the primary mass seems to need
some form of enrichment, as the contour adds little to the beauty of
that part. The symbol <i>X</i> could have been better located by being
moved to that place. The point of concentration should be placed
in the upper portion of a large mass whenever that arrangement
is possible.</p>

<p>It is in every way desirable that all designs should be executed
full size and in full accord with the requirements of a shop working
drawing. In addition the technical rendering suggested in <a href="#Chap_XIII">Chapter
XIII</a> should be carefully used in each drawing.</p>

COLOR: HUE, VALUE, AND CHROMA; STAINS</h2>


<div class="sidenote">Need of
Harmonious
Color</div>

<p>In the previous chapters we have developed problems dealing
with proportions, contours, and surface enrichment. The use of
color, particularly in surface enrichment, is equally important
inasmuch as its use is often necessary to bring the project, as for
example a piece of furniture, into harmony with the surroundings
which furnish its final color environment. The incorrect use of color
may seriously mar a project otherwise correctly designed in line and
form, and may also weaken its influence in a particular setting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Use of Color
Systems</div>

<p>While there are a number of excellent systems of color notation,
it is well to bear in mind that a color system, however excellent, is a
good servant but a poor master. It is nevertheless considered as
essential to have a definite knowledge of some systematically developed
color system in order that we may methodically apply color
to the structural form with some degree of certainty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Color Pigments
for
Design
Rendering</div>

<p>For rendering drawings of problems involving the use of color
it is suggested that the beginner use the tempera, or opaque colors
now on the market. These colors readily adapt themselves to the
average problem, while their rich hues are more successful than those
produced from the ordinary water colors. Tubes of cobalt blue,
ultramarine, light chrome yellow, vermilion, emerald green, crimson
madder, black, and white will serve to solve the problems demanded
by this chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Application
of
Pigment<br /><br />Rendering of
Wood Stains</div>

<p>White is used to lighten and black to darken the pigments, which
should be mixed with water to the consistency of cream, and applied
to cover well the surface of the paper. One should guard against
a thin, transparent wash, as the desired effect is a velvety opaque
and evenly tinted surface only possible with the thick application
of color. The pigment will dry out about one-quarter lighter than
when first applied.
The usual school color box of three pigments is
useful for rendering wood stains. These pigments may be used in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
thin flat washes and will exhibit a transparent effect analogous to the
effect of a wood stain. The natural color of wood may be first
represented and, when dry, followed by a second thin wash of the
hue of the wood stain.</p>

<p>Lacking as we are in a definite color nomenclature or standards,
it now becomes necessary to describe the processes and define the
terms necessary to the designer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hue and
Hue
Rectangles</div>

<p><i>Hue</i> is the technical name for color; a change of color means a
change of hue. For the designer's purposes we will select twelve
equally graded colors or hues from the spectrum and term them
standard hues. Each hue will have twenty-seven modifications or
gradations, which is a sufficient number for our purpose. These
gradations are to be graphically recorded by and contained in a
diagram to be known as a <i>hue rectangle</i>. There are twelve of these
rectangles, one for each of the selected hues, and they are found
arranged in sequence in <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 454</a>.</p>

<p>By referring to <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 455</a>, it is seen that the twelve selected
standard hues are represented at what is termed <i>full chromatic
intensity</i>, which, to the designer, means hues of the full strength of his
color pigment. This is far short of the true color intensity of the
spectrum, but for industrial arts purposes these hues are strong
enough to serve as standards for comparison and classification.
The hues should be evenly graded from red at the left to red violet
at the right without noticeable unevenness in the gradations. Red
violet is the link which connects the right end with the left, thus
completing the circuit of the twelve hues. The following pigment
table gives name and symbol of various hues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Locating
Standard
Hues</div>

<p>It now becomes imperative to locate each standard hue at its
definite place in each rectangle. This invariably occurs at a predetermined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
point in the left vertical boundary of the rectangle of
that hue. From inspection of <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 455</a>, it is quickly seen that
violet seems to be the darkest hue; yellow the lightest, with the
others between these hues. This variation of what is termed their
value gives us a guide to their proper placing in the hue rectangle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Values and
Horizontal
Value Lines</div>

<p><i>Value</i> is that quality by which we may distinguish a dark hue
from a light one. For design purposes we will imagine the hue
rectangle to grade from white at the top to black at the bottom.
We will draw horizontal lines or steps across the rectangle, marking
nine even value steps from white to black; the top one to be termed
White (W), followed by High Light (HL); Light (L); Low Light
(LL); Middle (M); High Dark (HD); Dark (D); Low Dark (LD);
and Black (B). These value steps may be thought of as a scale of
gray or neutral values descending the <i>right boundary</i> of the hue rectangle.
They have been roughly indicated in the hue rectangle at
the left of <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 454</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation of
the Standard
Hue to the
Hue Rectangle</div>

<p>Each standard hue may now be located in the <i>left boundary</i>
of its hue rectangle and opposite its neutral gray equivalent in the
right boundary. If the standard hue is accurately determined by
the designer, it will be of exactly the same value as its gray equivalent
given in the "value" column of the pigment table. The small arrows
leading from <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 455</a> to <a href="#Plate_64">454</a> show where four standard hues are
located; the remaining hues are located in the left circle of each successive
row in the remaining rectangles, and upon their respective
value lines. Standard hues are expressed by the symbols in the
<i>right column</i> of the pigment table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tints</div>

<p>Each standard pigment or hue may be thinned with opaque
white to lighten it, forming what is known as a tint of that hue.
Red, in <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 454</a>, reaching its full chromatic intensity at the value
High Dark, may be lightened four times before it ultimately arrives
at white. Each step is to be considered as occurring in the left hand
boundary of the rectangle above the standard hue, and is to be
recorded by the symbols, R-M: R-LL: R-L: R-HL. Orange yellow
has only one possible tint. Strawberry, light lavender, rose, etc.,
are merely nicknames for various tints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shades</div>

<p>Each standard hue may be darkened by the application of
black, thus forming shades of that hue. Red is capable of producing
two shades, R-D and R-LD, which are placed in the left boundary
of the hue rectangle below the standard hue. Browns, russets, and
dark tans are shades of different hues.</p>

<p>These modifications of the standard hues into tints and shades
give to the designer simple variations of his too brilliant standards.
But even these modifications are not sufficiently grayed for staining
or painting large wood or wall surfaces. There is a brilliancy and
glare about certain tints which require modification. The shades
are safer for use on large areas. The remaining space in the interior
of the hue rectangle is to be devoted to the last gradation of the
standard hue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chroma</div>

<p><i>Chroma</i> is the strength of a color. It is the quality by which we
distinguish a strong color from a weak one. The standard hue is
approximately full chromatic intensity. Likewise each tint and
shade is considered to be of its full chromatic intensity, making the
left-hand boundary of the rectangle the area of full chroma.</p>

<p>From this boundary, each tint, standard, and shade <i>fades out or
loses chroma</i> until the right boundary of the rectangle is reached. In
this boundary each tint, standard, and shade has faded out of its gray
equivalent, but without changing its original value; in other words it
has traveled along its horizontal value line to a complete grayness.
The right-hand boundary of the rectangle may then be represented
by a gray value scale of nine steps, including white and black.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vertical
Chroma
Lines</div>

<p>It becomes necessary to record at regular intervals, this loss of
chroma. For this purpose, we have cut the hue rectangle by three
vertical lines. The first vertical line from the left boundary of the
rectangle marks the position where the standard with its tints and
shades have been grayed to the point where only three-fourths of
the original of hue remains. Similarly, the center and right vertical
lines mark the points where one-half and one-fourth, respectively,
of the color have been retained. These losses of chroma are recorded
by similar fractions. With possible modifications of value and
chroma each hue now has twenty-seven possible changes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Full Hue
Symbols</div>

<p>The full hue title or symbol may now be written as follows:
(1) hue name, (2) amount of chroma, (3) value. Examples: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
GB&frac34;D-V&frac12;HL. We are now in a position to write whatever color we
may have in mind and another person will understand it, provided
the other person adopts our standard. Through the teachings of
Dr. D.W. Ross, Mr. A.H. Munsell, and others, the symbols and
standards are now quite generally understood and have, in a slightly
modified form been accepted in several standard color industries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Technical
Practice<br /><br />Warm and
Cold Colors</div>

<p>To familiarize oneself with the mixing of the various hues,
it is excellent practice to form a vertical gray scale of the three-quarter-inch
squares. There should be nine steps from white to
black; an enlarged duplication of the right boundary of the hue
rectangle.
The warm standard hues at their full standard intensities;
RV-R-OR-O-OY-Y, may be formed and placed opposite
their gray equivalents on the left side of the gray scale, while the
remaining or cold colors may be similarly placed with relation to the
gray scale but upon the right of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scales of
Color</div>

<p>A vertical scale of tints and shades of one of the hues, duplicating
the left side of the rectangle gives the character of the tints and shades.
One shade and one tint should then be carried along a horizontal
value line through three steps of loss of chroma to complete grayness,
but without change of the original value. Yellow, by the addition
of black becomes a false greenish shade which may be corrected by the
addition of a small amount of vermilion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wood Stains</div>

<p>A large percentage of natural wood hues are to be found between
the hue rectangles, Red-Orange, Yellow and Green, or in the warm
portion of the spectrum. As a wood stain must blend harmoniously
with the natural wood color, it is reasonable to expect the best results
from stains with a predominance of warm hues or warm grays in
their composition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Basic
Primary
Hues</div>

<p>It is possible to duplicate <i>nearly all</i> the twelve standard hues of
<a href="#Plate_64">Figure 455</a> with mixtures of the three so-called primary hues of red,
yellow, and blue. It makes a fairly approximate scale which is,
however, not sufficiently accurate for standardizing purposes.
The scale is formed by mixing red and yellow in varying proportions
for the intermediate hues of orange, yellow, and blue for the greens,
and blue and red for the violets. This practice of mixing three primary
colors together serves as an important step, governing wood
stain mixing for beginners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Three
Basic
Aniline Wood
Dyes</div>

<p>Developing this idea further, we may select aniline brilliant
scarlet as approximating red; metanil yellow, approximating yellow;
and acid green as a substitute for blue. These stains are shown in
the top portion of <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 456</a>. By comparison with <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 455</a>,
scarlet is found to be orange red; metanil yellow, orange, and acid
green to be true standard green. These basic stains have been
located in their proper positions with regard to their hue, value, and
chroma. Their positions are located by the large circles in the hue
diagrams of <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 456</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wood Stain
Mixing</div>

<p>These stains are modified and reduced in chroma and value by
mixing them with nigrosene black, an aniline dye of blue black
appearance, which fills all the needs of an ivory black in water or oil
color pigment. With these four stains, almost any commercial stain
may be duplicated. Aniline dye for water stains readily dissolves
in water while a special aniline for oil staining is first cut with naphtha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dark
Mahogany
Stain</div>

<p>Dark mahogany stain in <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 456</a> is orange red, ¾HD, and is
indicated by the circle <i>A</i> in the same figure. To duplicate this stain
we have as the nearest base stain, brilliant scarlet, which corresponds
to orange red. This is placed at its full intensity in the circle OR
on the middle horizontal value line. To duplicate dark mahogany
stain it will be necessary to reduce in value a strong solution of
brilliant scarlet, slightly more than one horizontal value step, by the
addition of nigrosene. We shall then add a small amount of some
thinning medium, oil or water, to reduce slightly the stain in chroma.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flemish
Oak Stain</div>

<p>Flemish oak stain is orange ¾D. This calls for a mixture of
metanil yellow and brilliant scarlet aniline to form the orange hue.
We must then add nigrosene to reduce the value to D, and add a small
amount of thinner to produce the necessary reduction in chroma.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fumed
Oak Stain</div>

<p>This is commonly produced by fuming the wood with ammonia.
The hue may however be closely duplicated by a mixture of brilliant
scarlet, metanil yellow, and nigrosene. It is practically the same
as Flemish oak, but possesses one-quarter more color as can be seen
on the orange hue rectangle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Olive Green
Stain</div>

<p>The circle <i>D</i> shows this stain to be slightly below yellow green,
¾M, in value and chroma. The hue rectangle containing it is nearer
the green than the orange yellow rectangle; hence in mixing the
stain we should keep the green hue dominant by adding more of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
than of metanil yellow. As in other stains, nigrosene is added to
reduce the full chromatic intensities of the aniline to the proper
value and chroma of olive green stain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Light
Weathered
Oak Stain<br /><br />Color
Changes of
the Stain</div>

<p>This stain is practically blue, 1/4M, and is formed by thinning
nigrosene to the proper value.</p>

<p>Aniline dyes are apt to fade if exposed to full sunlight. There
are, however, certain preventives that are beyond the scope of this
book to treat in detail. The natural color of the wood is inclined
to make a stain warmer than when originally mixed. This should
be allowed for. Wood filler, the wood grain, porosity, qualities, and
hue of the wood, all influence the final value of the stain.
It frequently
becomes darker in value as may be seen by comparing <a href="#Plate_64">Figure
456</a> and <a href="#Plate_65">Figures 458</a> to <a href="#Plate_65">461</a>. It is good policy to test the stain
upon different woods to observe the final effect. The tests may be
kept for future reference.</p>

<p>It is readily seen from the few examples in <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 456</a> that, with
the three basic stains, almost any other stains may be produced,
thus affording a broad field for harmonious selection and adaptation
to the environment. The <a href="#Chap_XVI">next chapters</a> will take up the question of
color harmony and its application to wood, wall surfaces, clay, and
metal.</p>

COLOR AND ITS RELATION TO INDUSTRIAL ARTS DESIGN</h2>

<h3 class="section">Large Surfaces of Wood; Wall and Ceiling Areas</h3>


<div class="sidenote">Color
Harmony</div>

<p>In the <a href="#Chap_XV">preceding chapter</a>, the classification and standardization
of color were emphasized as preliminary to the study of color harmony.
Color harmony is obtained by the proper balancing of value, hue, and
chroma upon a surface or surfaces to give a pleasing reaction to the
eye, and through the eye to the intellect.</p>

<p>We are now ready to familiarize ourselves with the specific applications
of these factors to practical design problems. Too many
pieces of furniture are stained with no thought as to the final adaptation
in the school or home. This is not wise, either from the standpoint
of a complete educative process or of good taste. Figures
<a href="#Plate_65">458</a>, <a href="#Plate_65">459</a>, <a href="#Plate_65">460</a>, <a href="#Plate_65">461</a>, show stains of <a href="#Plate_64">Plate 64</a> applied to wood. Two
new stains have been added, sage green and silver gray. These six
stains are representative ones and act as a typical data for study
of color harmony.</p>


<h3 class="section">Furniture&mdash;Trim&mdash;Side Walls&mdash;Ceilings</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Backgrounds</div>

<p>The side walls of a room form the background for furniture;
trim, wall brackets, and similarly related objects; therefore the
<i>closest relation and harmony</i> should be maintained between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value Range
of Wood
Stains</div>

<p>The wood stains 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, <a href="#Plate_65">Plate 65</a>, as they appear
on various kinds of wood are, in part, duplicates of the unapplied
stains of <a href="#Plate_64">Plate 64</a>, <a href="#Plate_64">Figure 456</a>. The effect of the wood has changed
their values and in some instances their color as can be seen by comparing
the two plates. Their <i>new relations</i> have been plotted on the
hue rectangles of <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>, <a href="#Plate_65">Plate 65</a>, and the results joined by a
dotted line. The circles in the diagrams contain cross reference
figures in order that the stains may be traced without difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The highest value is near middle (18), and the lowest is low dark (6),
showing a value range of four steps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value Range
of Side Walls</div>

<p>The side walls, taken from well-known wall tint catalogs have
been similarly plotted in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>, and the results joined together
by a heavy black line. The lightest value is light (11), and the darkest
is middle value (14), an average range of three steps slightly
above middle value.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value Range
of Ceilings</div>

<p>Ceilings are the lightest of the surfaces considered. Their
range is from slightly below white (10), to light (16), a range of two
values. From the results, as plotted in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>, it is seen that
there is a tendency to keep the ceilings within a close range of values.
The results have been joined together by means of a double black
line. There are exceptions to these results, but it is quite safe to
keep well within the suggested range for harmonious results. We
may now draw the following rules as a result of an empirical method
of deduction.</p>

<p>Rule 12a. <i>An average wood stain is to be retained between the
values middle and low dark.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12b. <i>An average wall hue is to be retained between the values
light and middle.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12c. <i>An average ceiling hue is to be retained between the
values white (minus) and light.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Value Range
of Side Walls
and Wood
Work</div>

<p>Averaging the value range between the wood work which includes
the furniture, trim, and the side walls of <a href="#Plate_65">Figures 458</a>, <a href="#Plate_65">459</a>, <a href="#Plate_65">460</a>, <a href="#Plate_65">461</a>,
<a href="#Plate_65">462</a>, and <a href="#Plate_65">463</a>, we find that the range varies from five values in <a href="#Plate_65">Figures
459</a> to slightly more than one in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 463</a>. As the side walls and
furniture are to be regarded as unobtrusive settings for pictures and
people it is well to be very conservative with the use of values. A
wide range of values will cause a lack of unity. In this respect
<a href="#Plate_65">Figure 459</a> may be regarded as approaching the extreme limit of
contrasts of value compatible with good taste. Let us, therefore,
limit the value range to four values, as, for example: low light for
side walls and dark for stain.</p>

<p>Rule 12d. <i>The relation between the side walls and furniture,
trim, etc., should be retained within the range of four values or less, as
low light and dark.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Value Range
of Side
Walls and
Ceilings</div>

<p>The ceiling and side walls in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 459</a> are four values apart
and in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 463</a> this has been reduced to a one-value step. There
seems to be a common average of three values as an acceptable and
agreeable contrast. For dark rooms this would well be increased.
For rooms with light side walls the contrast would be considerably
lessened.</p>

<p>Rule 12e. <i>The relation between side walls and ceiling should be
within the range of three values or less, as high light and low light.</i></p>


<h3 class="section">Hue Groupings</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Hue Range
for Wood
Work and
Walls</div>

<p>A wood stain should be closely related to the natural color of the
wood. As this is usually a warm color we naturally find most of the
wood stains included between the red and the yellow hue rectangles,
inclusive of red and yellow green. Walnut then may be stained a
deep shade of orange or red, but would not be adapted to a blue green
stain. This arbitrary but wide range of hues of stained wood naturally
affects the hue of the side walls. The plotting of the hues for
the side walls, <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>, shows a close relation to the hues of the
stain to the wall. In no instance do we find the hue rectangle of the
wood work more than three hues away from that of the walls. In
four instances they are within two hue rectangles of each other and in
one instance they are both within the same rectangle. This develops
the fact that <i>analogous</i> or neighboring groupings of hues prevail in
relating the hues of wood work and side walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analogous
Hues</div>

<p>An <i>analogous</i> group of hues is an arrangement based upon a
selection of tints and shades within three rectangles of each other, as
orange and yellow. These harmonize because yellow is mixed with
and becomes a hue common to both. While the analogous arrangement
of hues seems to be most commonly used, and with a result that
seems to justify its adoption into general practice, there are other
arrangements that are pleasing to the eye.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrasted
Hues</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_65">Figure 458</a> illustrates what is commonly known as a <i>contrasted</i>
grouping or arrangement of hues. It consists of the tints or shades
of one or more hues and gray. It is the basis of color harmony
between silver and semi-precious stones. If two hues are used, one
of them should be reduced in chroma to nearly gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dominant
Hue</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_65">Figure 463</a> is typical of still another form of positive hue grouping.
By consulting the yellow hue rectangle of <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a> it is noted
that the wood work, side walls, and ceiling of <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 463</a> <i>are all contained
in one rectangle</i>. This classes this color scheme as an example
of <i>dominant</i> arrangement which may be simply defined as the <i>tints
and shades of one hue</i>. The arrangement does not have the variety
supplied by analogous grouping, introducing as it does, two hues from
different rectangles, but for large surfaces dominant grouping is a
conservative and safe arrangement. Its tendency toward monotony
should be guarded against by the introduction of some object high
in chroma in the room decorative scheme. A bright colored vase
will accomplish this successfully. Rule 12o, <a href="#Chap_XVII">Chapter XVII</a>.</p>

<p>Rule 12f. <i>Color schemes for wood work and side walls should
preferably be selected from one of the following groupings: analogous,
contrasted, or dominant arrangements of hues. Analogous grouping is
preferable where variety of hue is desirable.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Special
Arrangements</div>

<p>The above rule is not to be taken as arbitrary. In the hands
of competent designers attractive color schemes are developed
that differ materially from the above suggestions. But, for the
usual home setting, the above arrangement may be regarded as
satisfactory, and is given with the idea of bringing the school shop
work and the home environment into closer color harmony. A
specimen of special arrangement is given by the Circle 3A. This is
delft blue, which harmonizes with dark mahogany in a satisfactory
manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hue Range
for Side
Walls and
Ceilings</div>

<p>In adjusting the hues for side walls and ceilings, the relations
should be of the closest. The plotting of ceiling hues in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>
shows a strong tendency for the ceiling to be colored with a tint of
the side walls (dominant arrangement), or by a tint selected from the
next rectangle (analogous arrangement). Yellow or yellow-green,
very light and much reduced in chroma, seems to be the almost
universal custom. This is due to the strongly <i>light reflecting</i> qualities
of yellow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_65" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_209.jpg" width="500" height="368" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 65</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Rule 12g. <i>Ceilings should be colored by a lighter tint of the side
walls or by a lighter tint of an analogous hue.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Range of
Chroma
for Stains</div>

<p>Stains, as they occupy a comparatively limited area in the room
color scheme, are of their full chroma value or reduced to three-fourths
chroma. In only one instance (18), <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 463</a>, do we find
a reduction to one-fourth chroma, demanded by the nearly gray
color scheme of the walls. We find it to be an established fact that
small areas are capable of enrichment by colors of greater purity
and higher chroma than larger surfaces. A silver pin may be designed
to contain a stone of high brilliancy, but a wall surface has to be materially
reduced in chroma to possess color harmony.</p>

<p>Rule 12h. <i>Stains are usually not reduced to below three-fourths
chromatic intensity. Nearly gray side walls, however, call for a reduction
to one-fourth intensity.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Range of
Chroma for
Walls</div>

<p>As the walls occupy a large proportionate area of the color
scheme of the room we find it necessary to reduce them in chroma in
order to soften the glare of too brilliant colors. <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a> shows
only one instance (14) of a hue unreduced in chroma. It is retained
at the full chroma for that value on account of the brightness of the
sage green wood stain. The other hues represented in the diagram
are grayed or reduced in chroma from three-fourths to less than one-fourth,
or to nearly neutral gray.</p>

<p>Rule 12i. <i>Wall colors are usually reduced to three-fourths chroma
to a minimum reduction of slightly less than one-fourth chroma.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Range of
Chroma for
Ceilings</div>

<p>The same tendency toward chromatic reduction is to be seen in ceilings,
although we have two examples in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a> (10 and 13) of nearly
white and high light ceilings that have not been reduced. To avoid
crudity a reduction in chroma by the addition of gray is to be desired.</p>

<p>Rule 12j. <i>Ceilings should usually be reduced in chroma to three-fourths
intensity with slightly less than one-fourth chroma as a minimum
reduction.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary</div>

<p>With a single exception (3A), the stains and wall tints have
been selected between and including the red and green rectangles.
This is customary and gives safe hue range as it insures the
retention of wall and ceiling hues in unified conformity with the warm
tints of the natural wood and its equally dark hued stains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wall and
Ceiling
Pigments</div>

<p>The following is a list of dry colors which may be purchased at a
paint or hardware store for a few cents a pound. It is suggested
for the designer or craftsman who desires to tint his own wall or
ceiling. While oil paint is to be preferred, these colors are readily
and quickly applied and form serviceable backgrounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Calcimine</div>

<p>The pigments are white, yellow ochre, chrome yellow light,
chrome yellow medium, and chrome yellow dark, burnt and raw
sienna, turkey and raw umber, ultramarine and ivory black. The
greens are preferably mixed by adding ultramarine to one of the
chromes. Shades are formed by the addition of the siennas, umbers,
or black. Black and white, mixed to a gray, are useful in reducing
the chroma of a hue. The stains should be mixed with hot water
and a small amount of glue for a binder. White occasionally comes
prepared with glue in its composition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opaque
Wood
Finishes</div>

<p>While this chapter has emphasized the transparent finish for
wood treatment, as a method best fitted for woods with a distinct
grain, it is realized that oil painting of wood surfaces has a distinct
and important part to play in the interior decorative scheme of a
room. This latter method is adapted to soft woods without a strongly
marked grained surface. The warm hued rectangle of the spectrum:
red, orange, and yellow with their associated hues, which are so intimately
connected with the natural wood colors and their stains, no
longer stand as a limiting factor in controlling the color of the wood or
the side walls. The opaque nature of oil paints allows us to disregard
the color of the wood, and thus select any hue of oil paint which harmonizes
with the walls and decorative scheme of the room. The
rules stated herein are equally applicable to opaque colors. It may
be necessary to reduce oil paints in chroma beyond the point indicated
in Rule 12h.</p>

<p>While it is not within the scope of this chapter to enter into a
complete discussion of the subject of interior decoration, the following
suggestions are considered as applying to our subject: viz., the
surface enrichment of large areas. Complete color harmony in
interior decoration generally demands the presence of the three so-called
primary hues: red, yellow, and blue, in some form in the wall
color scheme. While this is not always possible, two may be introduced
as follows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Northern
Exposure</div>

<p>The light from the north, northeast, or northwest is cold blue,
supplying blue in the decorative scheme of three primary colors:
blue, red, and yellow. The wall tints should then be composed of
combinations of red and yellow, the remaining primaries. These
may be applied to the walls by means of tints of yellow and orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
reduced in chroma, or shades of orange and orange-red. No greens
or blues should be used.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Southern
Exposure</div>

<p>The light from the south, southeast, and southwest supplies
plenty of yellow. It is, then, necessary to add the remaining primaries
or at least one of them in the form of gray-blue, orange, or
orange-yellow, reduced to one-fourth chroma and practically to
neutrality or grayish-reds and greens, well reduced in chroma. Any
hue strongly yellow should be avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
Hue upon
Apparent
Size</div>

<p>Certain hues materially affect the apparent size of a room. If
the room is small certain values and hues will make it appear much
smaller. Dark values, as a rule, make the room look smaller by
seemingly drawing the walls closer together. Red contracts the
apparent size of a room, while yellow and blue expand it. Green
and shades of yellow and red-orange, if not too dark, have little effect
upon the apparent size of a room.</p>


<blockquote>
<h3>SUMMARY OF DESIGN STEPS</h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Determine, by its exposure, the kind of light the room receives.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Choose a hue for the walls embodying one or both of the primary hues not
represented by this daylight.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Select a value and chroma for this hue in accordance with Rules 12b and 12i.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Select a hue, value, and chroma for the ceiling in accordance with Rules
12g, 12e, and 12j.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Select the correct hue, value, and chroma for paint or stain for the wood
work in accordance with Rules 12f, 12a, and 12h.</p>


<h3>SUGGESTED PROBLEMS</h3>

<p>Develop the color scheme for the walls, ceiling, and wood work of a room
with a northern exposure; southern exposure. Mix the stain for a piece of
oak to harmonize with the wood work and walls of the living room of your home.</p>

<p>Determine the wall tints to harmonize with dark weathered oak. Mix
them from dry colors.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF RULES</h3>

<p>Rule 12a. <i>An average wood stain is to be retained between the values middle
and low dark.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12b. <i>An average wall hue is to be retained between the values light
and middle.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12c. <i>An average ceiling hue is to be retained between the values white
(minus) and light.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12d. <i>The relation between the side walls and furniture, trim, etc.,
should be retained within the range of four values or less, as low light and dark.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Rule 12e. <i>The relation between the side walls and ceiling should be within
the range of three values or less, as high light and low light.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12f. <i>Color schemes for wood work and side walls should preferably
be selected from one of the following groupings: analogous, contrasted, or dominant
arrangements of hues. Analogous grouping is preferable where variety of hue is
desirable.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12g. <i>Ceilings should be colored by a lighter tint of the side walls or by a
lighter tint of an analogous hue.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12h. <i>Stains are usually not reduced to below three-fourths chromatic
intensity. Nearly gray side walls, however, call for a reduction to one-fourth
intensity.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12i. <i>Wall colors are usually reduced to three-fourths chroma to a minimum
reduction of slightly less than one-fourth chroma.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12j. <i>Ceilings should usually be reduced in chroma to three-fourths intensity,
with slightly less than one-fourth chroma as a minimum reduction.</i></p>


<h3>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h3>

COLOR AND ITS RELATION TO INDUSTRIAL ARTS
DESIGN</h2>


<h3 class="section">Small Surfaces in Clay and Metal</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to the discussion of the application of color
to clay it becomes necessary to determine what technical possibilities
are presented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Color Applied
to the
Surface
Enrichment
of Clay</div>

<p>Plain glazing of the entire surface is a common form of pottery
enrichment. A piece of ware, thus glazed, may become a point of
concentration in the color arrangement of a room, and should be
definitely located in that arrangement. The ware may harmonize
with the background (side wall) by analogy, dominance, or contrast
or through complementary coloring. Rule 12o. A glaze from
the diagram in <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a> should be selected as forming a part in
the selected arrangement. Side wall (11), <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>, would harmonize
with glaze C9 by virtue of its dominant relation or with M7
through analogy. The glaze selected should be higher in chroma
than the side wall and will be found to form a cheerful and brilliant
element in the room color scheme. The definite linking of these
different factors of interior decoration into unity has been earnestly
advocated in these chapters. <a href="#Plate_65">Figures 457</a> and <a href="#Plate_66">464</a> show the possibilities
of cross references.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stains for
Glazes</div>

<p>It soon becomes apparent because of the coloring of clay ware
that the designer must know something of the color possibilities of
glazed pottery forms. The decorative processes were explained at
some length in <a href="#Chap_XII">Chapter XII</a>, wherein we described the common
types of surface enrichment. As we are now primarily considering
the question of color, we first regard the ware as uniformly glazed
with either clear or matt glaze. The former is brilliant, of high
chroma, and has a highly polished surface, while the latter is dull
surfaced glaze of lower chroma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Metallic
Oxides</div>

<p>Metallic oxides are used to stain or color clear glazes, while underglaze
colors are ordinarily used for matts. The percentage of stains
to be added to the dry glazes is stated in <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a> where they can
be readily traced to their approximate locations in the hue rectangles
by the reference letters M1, C1, etc. Certain oxides are weak coloring
agents and require larger amounts of oxide to color the glaze
perceptibly.</p>

<p>Iron and copper oxide may be mixed to produce a large variety
of yellow greens; other combinations will suggest themselves. It
is possible to use oxides as well as underglaze colors for staining
matt glazes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harmony
of Color</div>

<p>We have, to this point, considered the enrichment of large surfaces
whose areas were arbitrarily determined by construction, as,
for example, the extent of wall surface, ceiling, or wood trim and
furniture. The essential element in this type of problem is the
selection of a one, two, or three-hued color arrangement that would
harmoniously link ceiling, wall, and wood together. If we had
introduced stencilling or figured wall paper it would have immediately
called for the solution of another problem, the factor of <i>how
much</i> strong color to use. In other words, it would have introduced
the question of <i>proportionate distribution</i> of color upon a given area.
It was thought best to limit the subject of proportionate distribution
to small areas, where the designer is often forced to make decisions
and to divide surfaces into proportionate color parts for his surface
enrichment.</p>

<p>We may now repeat the definition of harmony with the accentuation
placed upon a certain wording directly applicable to small
surfaces. Harmony is obtained by the proper balancing and <i>proportionate
distribution</i> of value, hue, and chroma upon a surface to
give a unified and pleasing reaction to the eye and intellect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proportionate
Distribution
of Color
for Small
Areas</div>

<p>Rule 12k. <i>Proportionate distribution of hue, value, and chroma in
surface enrichment calls for a small area, high in chroma, and contrasting
in value to the rest of the surface but harmonizing with it. This
is usually located in the area of concentration. The larger areas are
to be sufficiently reduced in chroma and value to form a slight contrast
with the background.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Examples of
Proportionate
Distribution</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_66">Figure 465</a> illustrates some of the salient factors of distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of values and hues. Hues of or near standard chromatic intensity
should be used in <i>small quantities</i> and should accentuate the point
of concentration. These small areas are to be regarded as giving
brilliancy and life to the surface and to hold the eye at the point of
concentration. Very small surfaces are capable of sustaining spots
of high chroma, as is shown in the silver pin of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 468</a>. The
remaining portions of the surface enrichment should be kept subordinated
in hue and value to the point of concentration, <i>but related to it</i>.
The bands of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 465</a> are well reduced in value and make little
contrast with the background, thus forming true surface enrichment
or that which neither rises above or apparently falls through the
surface. The point of concentration is higher in chroma than the
surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Rule 12l. <i>One hue, or a group of analogous hues should dominate
all color schemes. The point of concentration may be emphasized by one
hue related to the other hues by (1) contrasted, (2) dominant, (3) analogous,
(4) complementary relations. This hue should make slightly stronger
value and chroma contrast than the remaining hues.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12m. <i>An extreme range of five values is generally sufficient to
supply contrast to a design but still retain its value unity. Restraint in
the use of values is essential.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12n. <i>The amount of chroma may be increased in proportion
to the decrease in the decorated area. Exceptions may be made to this
under Rule 12o.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Value and
Hue and
Chroma
Range for
Small Areas</div>

<p>In the vase, <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464A</a>, the designer selected hues from neighboring
or analogous rectangles green and blue-green. The value
range is restricted to four steps and the areas of concentration are
placed at the top of the vase by the stronger value and hue contrasts
of the foliage of the trees and dark blue rim. In both Figures, 464A
and 465, the designer has used analogous hue arrangements. This
is suggested to the beginner as serviceable for objects exceeding the
dimensions of jewelry and includes such problems as vase forms,
book stalls, and brackets. Contrasted and dominant arrangements
are also good, safe, and sound arrangements, but fail to give the variety
of color to small objects afforded by analogous grouping. At a
later point in this chapter the subject of complementary coloring
will suggest a new arrangement to the reader, but this scheme is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
be left until he has sufficiently mastered the possibilities of the
arrangements just indicated.</p>

<p>Five values form a safe value range for small objects. It is good
practice to keep the larger areas, including the background, within
three steps of each other and to allow the point of concentration to
form the strongest value contrast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Over
Reduction
in Chroma</div>

<p>The chroma may range from full to three-quarters intensity.
Reduction to one-half or one-fourth intensity is inclined to make a
small object appear washed out or chalky. Shades, at their full
intensity, are good colors to use for small surfaces in wood. Small
enameled objects may be developed in full chroma, while pottery
forms range from full chroma to one-half chroma in forms of slip and
underglaze painting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Color
Applied to
the Surface
Enrichment
of Metal</div>

<p>It is interesting to note the gradually increasing chroma percentage
of the different coloring media in direct proportion to the
reduction of the area of the surface to be enriched. By comparing the
diagrams of <a href="#Plate_66">Figures 464</a> and <a href="#Plate_65">457</a> it will be seen that there is a steady
movement toward the left sides of the hue rectangles or toward
stronger intensity. The wall areas are shown to be lowest in chroma,
followed by the increasing intensity of wood stains, glazes, and enamels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enamels</div>

<p>Enamels, commonly used to enrich metal surfaces, are highest
in chroma of the decorative materials under discussion and are to be
treated with nearly as much restraint as one would use in enriching
a surface with semi-precious stones, for strong hues are cheapened by
excessive use. The plate in <a href="#Plate_61">Figure 436</a> has small circles filled with
enamel and a large field of chased or uncolored design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transparent
Enamels</div>

<p>Transparent enamels are comparable to clear glazes and the
coloring medium is the same. Their preparation is difficult and
therefore trade names have been given in the table of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a>.
As will be seen by consulting the diagram of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a>, T1, T2, T3,
etc., they are all at their full value intensity. Enamels, as supplied
by the trade, are much too intense for use in enrichment and consequently
are applied over a coating of colorless clear enamel, technically
named flux or fondant. As the thickness of coating of enamel
may vary, the hue classification is to be regarded as approximate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Plate_66" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_219.jpg" width="500" height="367" alt="Glaze Stains. Enamels." />
<p class="caption smcap">Plate 66</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Opaque
Enamels</div>

<p>Opaque enamels may be compared with matt glazes, for, while
the texture of the surface has a distinct gloss, the enamels themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
are not so strong in hue as the transparent enamels. By referring
to the diagram of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a>, it may be seen that many of the opaque
enamels are reduced in chroma, thus accounting for their softened hue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oxidation</div>

<p>Metals are capable of considerable change of color by the application
of chemicals to the surface. Potassium sulphuret will lower
the surface value of silver or copper to a rich velvety black associated
with antiques. This may be removed in places naturally subjected
to wear, thus varying the dead black appearance. Copper and brass
may be coated with salt and vinegar or verdigris to give the surface
a corroded and greenish appearance. Heating is a fugitive method
of coloring and is, therefore, not considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harmony
through
Oxidation</div>

<p>These surface changes may be utilized to harmonize metal and its
environment, as, for example, copper trimmings and a shade for a
pottery lamp; or it may be used to reduce the brightness of the
natural copper surface.</p>

<p>The surfaces of metals may be changed with actual manipulation
of the surface by frosting or sanding and plating. Gold may be
readily plated with gold to bring it into closer harmony with the
stone. Plating, applied to base metals, merely to give the impression
of a more expensive metal, is to be discouraged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Metal
Backgrounds</div>

<p>One has to consider metal as a background in much the same
manner as we considered wall surfaces as a background for stained
furniture. Whatever color is applied to the surface must harmonize
in proportionate distribution as well as hue, value, and chroma. We
have a small amount of leeway for varying the background by the
different processes of oxidation and plating.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enamel on
a Copper
Background</div>

<p>As one of the more common processes, let us consider the application
of enamel to copper in the form of champleve enrichment.
Our first thought would be the analysis of the natural copper color.
It is found to be a shade of orange-red and will, therefore, readily
harmonize with the <i>analogous</i> oranges and reds, as they both have the
common hue of red. There should be a slight contrast of value
between these enamels and the background. If this contrast is not
present, it is well to oxidize slightly the copper to lower its value and
thus produce the contrast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complementary
Arrangement</div>

<p>The fourth harmonious hue combination, that of complementary
arrangement or grouping, has been left to the last as its use is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
closely associated with small multi-colored projects and small areas.
A hue approximately complementary to the initial hue is found by
counting seven rectangles to the right or left of that hue; this will
give the hue complementary to the initial hue. Thus, starting with
red and moving through seven rectangles toward the right, we find
the complement to be green. Any two hues so selected will be found
to enhance the brilliancy of each other. The best results are secured
when one hue dominates the color scheme by its increased area.
Pottery may be adapted to a complementary color scheme by Rule 12i.</p>

<p>Rule 12o. <i>Small one or two-hued projects in clay, designed to be
used as a part of the decorative color scheme for a room should bear a
contrasted, dominant, analogous, or complementary relation to the side
walls of the room. The project may be much higher in chroma than the
side walls.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Relation
of Colored
Glazes to
Interior
Decoration
of a Room</div>

<p>To find a glaze that will harmonize with the side walls of a room
by complementary arrangement of hues, select the desired wall tint
from the diagram in <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>. Find the similar hue rectangle in
the diagram of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a> and, starting with this rectangle as one,
count seven hues from the side wall rectangle in either direction.
In the seventh rectangle or in a neighboring one will usually be found
a number of glazes answering the requirements and bearing a complementary
relation to the side walls. Select a glaze from these that
will make a contrast of chroma or value with the side wall. Example:
background or side wall, <a href="#Plate_65">Figure 457</a>, No. 8, is in the orange yellow
rectangle. Counting seven from this in <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a> we find the complement
to be blue violet. As there is no glaze in this rectangle we
will move to its neighbor on the left. This gives us clear glaze, C1,
containing one and one-half per cent black oxide of cobalt, or a matt
glaze containing seven per cent mazarine blue.</p>

<p>Glazes that will harmonize with side wall 8 through dominant
arrangements are found in the same rectangle, O Y, and are numbered
M5, M6, C7, C8. Glazes that will harmonize by analogy
are C9 and M7, and are found in the left and right neighboring
rectangles.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 466</a>, the copper fob, R O, is combined with its complementary
blue-green. Let us look at <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 464</a>. Counting seven
intervals or hue rectangles to the right of the orange red rectangle we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
find T4 which is transparent blue green enamel. We may associate
with this an analogous enamel from the green rectangle; this proves
to be T5 medium green transparent enamel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Development
of Design
for Enamel
on Metal</div>

<p>The point of concentration may now be emphasized by an enamel
complementary to the blue green hue. Counting seven rectangles
to the <i>left</i> we again encounter the red orange rectangle. Here there
are no enamels but in the red hue rectangle we find T7 which is slightly
orange-red. A small portion of this, Rule 12k, is applied and is
found to center the design at the point of concentration in a satisfactory
manner. Slight oxidation brings out the colors of the
enamels.</p>

<p>Upon attempting to develop the same figure in opaque enamels it
is soon seen that there are no pleasing complementary enamels of this
type, but many analogous combinations. Autumn brown with the
point of concentration developed in orange (O5) would be an excellent
compromise.</p>

<p>Rule 12p. <i>Correct color for surface enrichment should neither
apparently rise above nor drop below the surface to which it is applied,
but should stay upon the plane of that surface. Correct value and chroma
range will accomplish this.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Color for
Silver
Enrichment</div>

<p>The gray-blue color of silver lends itself to a great number of gem
stones, forming examples of contrasted arrangements. Care should
be taken to form contrasts of <i>value</i>. <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 467</a> is an example of a
weak and insipid combination, lacking in value and hue contrast.
The amethyst of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 468</a> corrects this error, while the oxidation
of <a href="#Plate_66">Figure 469</a> has partially corrected the lack of contrast shown in
<a href="#Plate_66">Figure 467</a>. These illustrations tend to show that even stronger
contrasts may be attempted with small gems and semi-precious
stones than with enamels. This again proves the rule that the
smaller areas are capable of sustaining stronger contrasts of hue,
value, and chroma than are large ones.</p>

<p>Design a pottery and copper lamp with amber art glass in the shade.
Through oxidation and glazing, bring the lamp into color unity.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF RULES</h3>

<p>Rule 12k. <i>Proportionate distribution of hue, value, and chroma in surface
enrichment calls for a small area high in chroma and contrasting in value to the
rest of the surface, but harmonizing with it. This is usually located in the area
of concentration. The larger areas are to be sufficiently reduced in chroma and
value to form a slight contrast with the background.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Hues for Small Objects</h3>

<p>Rule 12l. <i>One hue, or a group of analogous hues should dominate all color
schemes. The point of concentration may be emphasized by one hue related to the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<i>other hues by (1) contrasted, (2) dominant, (3) analogous, or (4) complementary
relations. This hue should make slightly stronger value and chroma contrast than
the remaining hues.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Values for Small Objects</h3>

<p>Rule 12m. <i>An extreme range of five values is generally sufficient to supply
contrast to a design but still retain its value unity. Restraint in the use of values
is essential.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Chroma for Small Objects</h3>

<p>Rule 12n. <i>The amount of chroma may be increased in proportion to the decrease
in the decorated area. Exceptions may be made to this under Rule 12o.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12o. <i>Small one or two-hued projects in clay, designed to be used as a
part of the decorative color scheme for a room should bear a contrasted, dominant,
analogous, or complementary relation to the side walls of the room. The project
may be much higher in chroma than the side walls.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12p. <i>Correct color for surface enrichment should neither apparently
rise above nor drop below the surface to which it is applied, but should stay upon
the plane of that surface. Correct value and chroma range will accomplish this.</i></p>


<h3>REVIEW QUESTIONS</h3>

<p>1. State the value of mono-hued pottery in the decorative scheme of a room.</p>

<p>2. What are generally used as stains for clear glazes; matt glazes?</p>

<p>3. What is highest in chroma&mdash;matt, or clear glaze?</p>

<p>4. Make a table of metallic oxides and the hues produced by them.</p>

<p>5. Why will iron and copper oxides produce a yellow green stain? What stains
will be produced by cobalt and copper oxides; cobalt and manganese
oxides; cobalt and nickel oxides?</p>

<p>6. Describe the type of room which you regard as best fitted for clear glazed
pottery forms; matt glazed pottery forms.</p>

<p>7. Define harmony of color.</p>

<p>8. What is meant by proportionate distribution? Describe proportionate
distribution.</p>

<p>9. Give the value, hue, and chroma range for small areas. See Rules
12l, 12m, and 12n.</p>

<p>10. How does the size of the area to be enriched by color affect the color medium,
<i>i.e.</i>, stains, glazes, enamels, etc.?</p>

<p>11. Describe enamels, their types, characteristics, and range of hues. Consult
catalogs for fuller possibilities.</p>

<p>12. What is the effect of oxidation; what is its value?</p>

<p>13. Describe fully complementary arrangements and give illustrations for
enamel on silver or copper.</p>

<p>14. State the color scheme for a fob to be worn with a blue-green dress; with a
gray suit for a man.</p>

<p>15. Select a stone for a silver brooch that would harmonize with a light blue
dress; for a dress of orange dark hue and value. See catalogs of dealers
in semi-precious stones for color of stones.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL AND SPECIAL
RULES IN THE PRECEEDING CHAPTERS</h2>


<h3 class="ssection">Horizontal and Vertical Primary Masses</h3>

<p>Rule 1a. <i>A primary mass must be either vertical or horizontal according to
the intended service, unless prohibited by technical requirements.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Proportions of the Primary Mass</h3>

<p>Rule 1b. <i>The primary mass should have the ratio of one to three, three to four,
three to five, five to eight, seven to ten, or some similar proportion difficult for the eye
to detect readily and analyze.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Horizontal Space Divisions</h3>

<p>Rule 2a. <i>If the primary mass is divided into two horizontal divisions, the
dominance should be either in the upper or the lower section.</i></p>

<p>Rule 2b. <i>If the primary mass is divided into three horizontal divisions or
sections, the dominance should be placed in the center section with varying widths
in the upper and lower thirds.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Sequential Progression of Minor Horizontal Space Divisions</h3>

<p>Rule 2c. <i>A primary mass may be divided into three or more smaller horizontal
masses or sections by placing the larger mass or masses at the bottom and
by sequentially reducing the height measure of each mass toward the smaller
division or divisions to be located at the top of the mass.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Vertical Space Divisions</h3>

<p>Rule 3a. <i>If the primary mass is divided into two vertical divisions, the divisions
should be equal in area and similar in form.</i></p>

<p>Rule 3b. <i>If the primary mass is divided into three vertical divisions, the center
division should be the larger, with the remaining divisions of equal size.</i></p>

<p>Rule 3c. <i>In elementary problems, if more than three vertical divisions are
required, they should be so grouped as to analyze into Rules 3a, and 3b, or be exactly
similar.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Appendages</h3>

<p>Rule 4a. <i>The appendage should be designed in unity with, and proportionately
related to, the vertical or horizontal character of the primary mass, but subordinated
to it.</i></p>

<p>Rule 4b. <i>The appendage should have the appearance of flowing smoothly
and, if possible, tangentially from the primary mass.</i></p>

<p>Rule 4c. <i>The appendage should, if possible, echo or repeat some lines similar
in character and direction to those of the primary mass.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Outline or Contour Enrichment</h3>

<p>Rule 5a. <i>Outline enrichment should be subordinated to and support the
structure.</i></p>

<p>Rule 5b. <i>Outline enrichment should add grace, lightness, and variety to
the design.</i></p>

<p>Rule 5c. <i>Outline enrichment, by its similarity, should give a sense of oneness
or unity to the design, binding divergent members together.</i></p>

<p>Rule 5d. <i>Parts of one design differing in function should differ in appearance
but be co-ordinated with the entire design.</i></p>

<p>Rule 5e. <i>In cylindrical forms outline curves with a vertical tendency should
have their turning points or units of measurement in accordance with the horizontal
divisions of Rules 2a and 2b.</i></p>

<p>Rule 5f. <i>Dependent outline enrichment should be related to essential parts of
a design and influenced by their forms and functions; it must be consistent with the
idea of the subject.</i></p>

<p>Rule 5g. <i>A curve should join a straight line with either a tangential or right
angle junction.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Surface Enrichment</h3>

<p>Postulate. <i>The design should conform to the limitations and requirements
of tools, processes, and materials, and should be durable and suitable for service.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6a. <i>Surfaces to be enriched must admit of enrichment.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6b. <i>Surface enrichment must be related to the structural contours but
must not obscure the actual structure.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6c. <i>The treatment must be appropriate to the material.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Continuous Bands and Borders for Partly Enriched Surfaces</h3>

<p>Rule 6d. <i>Bands and borders should have a consistent lateral, that is, onward
movement.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6e. <i>Bands and borders should never have a prominent contrary motion,
opposed to the main forward movement.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6f. <i>All component parts of a border should move in unison with the
main movement of the border.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6g. <i>Each component part of a border should be strongly dynamic and, if
possible, partake of the main movements of the border.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6h. <i>Borders intended for vertical surfaces may have a strongly upward
movement in addition to the lateral movement, provided the lateral movement dominates.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6i. <i>Inlayed enrichment should never form strong or glaring contrasts
with the parent surface.</i></p>

<p>Rule 6j. <i>Carved surface enrichment should have the appearance of belonging
to the parent mass.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Enclosed Enrichment&mdash;Partly Enriched Panels for Surface Enrichment</h3>

<p>Rule 7a. <i>Marginal panel enrichment should parallel or be related to the
outlines of the primary mass and to the panel it is to enrich.</i></p>

<p>Rule 7b. <i>Marginal points of concentration in panels should be placed (1) preferably
at the corners or (2) in the center of each margin.</i></p>

<p>Rule 7c. <i>To insure unity of design in panels, the elements composing the point
of concentration and links connecting them must be related to the panel contour
and to each other.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Enclosed Enrichment&mdash;Fully Enriched Panels for Surface Enrichment</h3>

<p>Rule 7d. <i>The contours of fully enriched panels should parallel the outlines
of the primary mass and repeat its proportions.</i></p>

<p>Rule 7e. <i>The points of concentration for a fully enriched square panel may be
in its center or in its outer margin.</i></p>

<p>Rule 7f. <i>The points of concentration for a fully enriched vertical panel should
be in the upper portion of the panel.</i></p>

<p>Rule 7g. <i>The fully enriched panel and its contents should be designed in
unified relation to the structural outlines, with the center line of the panel coinciding
with the inceptive axis of the structure.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Free Ornament for Partly Enriched Surfaces</h3>

<p>Rule 8a. <i>Free ornament for partly or fully enriched surfaces should be based
and centered upon an inceptive axis of the structure.</i></p>

<p>Rule 8b. <i>Free ornament should be related and subordinated to the structural
surfaces.</i></p>

<p>Rule 8c. <i>Points of concentration in free enrichment of vertically placed masses
are usually located in and around the inceptive axis and above or below the geometric
center of the design.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Surface Enrichment of Clay</h3>

<p>Rule 9a. <i>Surface enrichment of clay must be so designed as to be able to withstand
the action of heat to which all ware must be submitted.</i></p>

<p>Rule 9b. <i>Incised, pierced, and modeled decoration in clay should be simple
and bold and thus adapted to the character of the material.</i></p>

<p>Rule 9c. <i>A border should not be located at the point of greatest curvature in the
contour of a cylindrical form. The contour curve is of sufficient interest in itself
at that point.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Surface Enrichment of Base and Precious Metals For Small Masses</h3>

<p>Rule 10a. <i>Designs in precious metals should call for the minimum amount of
metal necessary to express the idea of the designer for two reasons: (1) good taste;
(2) economy of material.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10b. <i>Contour and surface enrichment should never appear to compete
for attention in the same design.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10c. <i>Parts of a design differing in function should differ in appearance
but be co-ordinated with the entire design.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10d. <i>Surface enrichment should at some point parallel the contours of
both primary mass and point of concentration especially whenever the latter is a stone
or enamel.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10e. <i>In the presence of either stone or enamel as a point of concentration,
surface enrichment should be regarded as an unobtrusive setting, or background.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10f. <i>Stone or enamel used as a point of concentration should form contrast
with the metal, either in color, brilliancy, or value, or all three combined.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10g. <i>The inceptive axis should pass through and coincide with one axis
of a stone and at the same time be sympathetically related to the structure.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Rule 10h. <i>The position of the inceptive axis should be determined by: (1) use
of the project as ring, pendant, or bar pin, (2) character of the primary mass as
either vertical or horizontal in proportion.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10i. <i>Caution should be exercised with regard to the use of enamel.
Over-decoration by this material tends to cheapen both process and design.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10j. <i>All surface enrichment should have an appearance of compactness
or unity. Pierced spots or areas should be so used as to avoid the appearance
of having been scattered on the surface without thought to their coherence.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10k. <i>Built, carved, and chased enrichment should have the higher planes
near the point of concentration. It is well to have the stone as the highest point above
the primary mass. When using this form of enrichment, the stone should never
appear to rise abruptly from the primary mass, but should be approached by a series
of rising planes.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10l. <i>The lanes or margins between enameled spots should be narrower
than the lane or margin between the enamel and the contour of the primary mass.</i></p>

<p>Rule 10m. <i>Transparent and opaque stones or enamel should not be used in the
same design.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Surface Enrichment of Base and Precious Metals For Large Primary Masses</h3>

<p>Rule 11a. <i>The preliminary steps toward surface enrichment should be
thought out before they are drawn.</i></p>

<p>Rule 11b. <i>Conservative application should mark the use of surface enrichment
of large masses. Its use should: (1) lighten or soften necessarily heavy construction;
(2) support or apparently strengthen good structure; (3) add interest to large
unbroken and uninteresting surfaces.</i></p>

<p>Rule 11c. <i>The type of design unit for large masses should be bolder than
similar designs for small primary masses.</i></p>

<p>Rule 11d. <i>The eye should be attracted to one principal zone of enrichment,
whether located upon the primary mass, appendage, terminal, links, or details.
All other zones should be subordinate to this area.</i></p>

<p>Rule 11e. <i>Two periods of historic ornament should not be introduced into
the same design.</i></p>

<p>Rule 11f. <i>Repulsive forms should not be introduced into surface enrichment.</i></p>


<h3 class="ssection">Application of Color To Large Areas</h3>

<h3 class="sssection">VALUES</h3>

<p>Rule 12a. <i>An average wood stain is to be retained between the values middle
and low dark.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12b. <i>An average wall hue is to be retained between the values light
and middle.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12c. <i>An average ceiling hue is to be retained between the values white
(minus) and light.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12d. <i>The relation between the side walls and furniture, trim, etc.,
should be retained within the range of four values or less, as low light and dark.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12e. <i>The relation between the side walls and ceiling should be within
the range of three values or less, as high light and low light.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="sssection">HUES</h3>

<p>Rule 12f. <i>Color schemes for wood work and side walls should preferably
be selected from one of the following groupings: analogous, contrasted, or dominant
arrangements of hues. Analogous grouping is preferable where variety of hue is
desirable.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12g. <i>Ceilings should be colored by a lighter tint of the side walls or by a
lighter tint of an analogous hue.</i></p>


<h3 class="sssection">CHROMA</h3>

<p>Rule 12h. <i>Stains are usually not reduced to below three-fourths chromatic
intensity. Nearly gray side walls, however, call for a reduction to one-fourth
intensity.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12i. <i>Wall colors are usually reduced to three-fourths chroma to a minimum
reduction of slightly less than one-fourth chroma.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12j. <i>Ceilings should usually be reduced in chroma to three-fourths
intensity, with slightly less than one-fourth chroma as a minimum reduction.</i></p>


<h3 class="sssection">DISTRIBUTION</h3>

<p>Rule 12k. <i>Proportionate distribution of hue, value, and chroma in surface
enrichment calls for a small area, high in chroma, and contrasting in value to the
rest of the surface, but harmonizing with it. This is usually located in the area of
concentration. The larger areas are to be sufficiently reduced in chroma and value
to form slight contrast with the background.</i></p>


<h3 class="sssection">HUES FOR SMALL OBJECTS</h3>

<p>Rule 12l. <i>One hue, or a group of analogous hues should dominate all color
schemes. The point of concentration may be emphasized by one hue related to the
other hues by (1) contrasted, (2) dominant, (3) analogous, (4) complementary
relations. This hue should make slightly stronger value and chroma contrast
than the remaining hues.</i></p>


<h3 class="sssection">VALUES FOR SMALL OBJECTS</h3>

<p>Rule 12m. <i>An extreme range of five values is generally sufficient to supply
contrast to a design but still retain its value unity. Restraint in the use of values
is essential.</i></p>


<h3 class="sssection">CHROMA FOR SMALL OBJECTS</h3>

<p>Rule 12n. <i>The amount of chroma may be increased in proportion to the decrease
in the decorated area. Exceptions may be made to this under Rule 12o.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12o. <i>Small one or two-hued projects in clay, designed to be used as a
part of the decorative color scheme for a room should bear a contrasted, dominant,
analogous, or complementary relation to the side walls of the room. The project
may be much higher in chroma than the side walls.</i></p>

<p>Rule 12p. <i>Correct color for surface enrichment should neither apparently
rise above nor drop below the surface to which it is applied, but should stay upon
the plane of that surface. Correct value and chroma range will accomplish this.</i></p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_471">Figure 471</a> shows the actual results produced by the preceding
course. The process to which the individual pieces belong is
indicated by the small figure placed on the table and in front
of the ware. The preceding sheets should be regarded in the light
of suggestions for original thinking on the part of the student.
They merely suggest technical guidance, in order that his progress
may be sequential and fitted to his increasing skill.</p>

<p>The glazes are stated in the terms of the ceramist with the
proportions of base, alumina, and acid content of each glaze
clearly stated. By referring to the textbooks mentioned in the
preface, these glazes may be developed into the potter's formulae.</p>

<p>In both metal and pottery courses, two or more types are
frequently represented upon one plate. These types will allow
the teacher to assign a more difficult problem to the student
with some previous experience.</p>
